    "# Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "We are running a company that produces a particular type of luxury gifts: personalised jewellery with names. These pieces of jewellery are handcrafted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of a given piece of jewellery for a particular name (say \"Emma\") requires:\n",
    "  * A set of tasks to produce each individual letters (so \"E\", \"m\", \"m\", \"a\")\n",
    "  * A task to assemble all these letters together for producing the final piece of jewellery\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration for producing a particular letter depends on the letter itself (for instance producing the letter 'm' is more complex than production the letter 'a' so it will take longer [1]). The duration for producing the different letters is given in the data as a table. In the problem, all times are given in minutes (mn). \n",
    "\n",
    "The assembly task can be performed only after all the letters have been produced. Its duration is proportional to the number of letters to assemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration for each letter and the proportionality factor for assembly duration are given in file Data/data.json in JSON format, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "       \"assembly\" : 500,\n",
    "       \"letters\"  : {\n",
    "          \"A\": 1443,\n",
    "          \"B\": 1841,   \n",
    "          \"C\": 1247,\n",

    "    }\n",

    "As an example, the figure below display the process for producing a piece of jewellery for Emma. The arcs represent precedence constraints between tasks. The blue task in the end is the assembly task."

    "We are on Jan 1, 2020 and our company has collected the set of production orders for the year. A production order is a type of jewellery to produce (so, a name) and a due-date. We assume that all our customers want to have their gift ready for their birthday. Thus a production order is given by a pair (name,birthday). \n",

For instance if the gift for Emma is only available on 18/04 (so 3 days after Emma's birthday), the related tardiness penalty will be $3^2=9$.\n",
