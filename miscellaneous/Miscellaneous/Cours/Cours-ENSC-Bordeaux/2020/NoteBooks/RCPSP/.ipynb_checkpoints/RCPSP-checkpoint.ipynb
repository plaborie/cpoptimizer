    "# Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) is one of the most widely studied scheduling problem in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, a resource-constrained project scheduling problem considers a set of resources of limited availability and a set of tasks of known durations and known resource requirements, linked by precedence constraints. The problem consists of finding a schedule of minimal duration by assigning a start time to each task such that the precedence constraints and the resource limited availabilities are respected [AD-08].\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the RCPSP can be stated as follows. Given:\n",
    "  * a set of $n$ tasks with given durations,\n",
    "  * a set of $m$ resources with given capacities,\n",
    "  * a network of precedence constraints between the tasks, and\n",
    "  * for each task and each resource the amount of the resource\n",
    "  required by the task over its execution,\n",
    "  \n",
    "The goal of the RCPSP is to find a schedule satisfying all the constraints (i.e., precedence and resource capacity constraints) whose makespan (i.e., the time at which all tasks are finished) is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the problem on a tiny instance with 6 tasks and 2 resources in the figure below. For consistency with the data, we start the indexing of tasks and resources at 0.\n",
    "  * Resource $R_0$ has capacity 2\n",
    "  * Resource $R_1$ has capacity 3\n",
    "  * Task 0 has a duration of 2 and requires 1 unit of $R_0$ and 2 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 1 has a duration of 4 and requires 1 unit of $R_0$ and 1 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 2 has a duration of 1 and requires 2 unit of $R_0$ and 1 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 3 has a duration of 1 and requires 1 unit of $R_0$ and 1 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 4 has a duration of 1 and requires 1 unit of $R_0$ and 1 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 5 has a duration of 2 and requires 1 unit of $R_0$ and 2 unit of $R_1$\n",
    "  * Task 0 must execute before task 2 and task 3\n",
    "  * Task 2 must execute before task 4\n",
    "  * Task 3 must execute before task 4 and task 5\n"
