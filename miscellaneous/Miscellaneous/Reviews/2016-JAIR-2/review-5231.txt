Comments:

The article is a resubmission of an original version submitted earlier this year. As I reviewed the original version (Reviewer 1), the present review is mostly incremental.

In general, I think the authors satisfactorily addressed my questions/issues. The new version is more formal on different aspects of the approach, in particular the encoding of the problem as CSP and the decoding of the CSP solution to build a plan. 

There are two things that still puzzle me but I'm quite convinced that they are minor and can be fixed quite easily.

1) The first thing is that you seem to consider it as evident that two different actions will lead to two different rows in the CSP tables. I have the feeling that this is true because the table considers all preconditions and effects of the action thus if two actions result in the same row it probably implies that they have the same preconditions and effects (thus they do not need to be differentiated) but even so it would be better to say it explicitly. It is an important point because the decoding implicitly assumes 1 row = 1 action.

2) The second point is in a certain sense related to the first one as it is also about the possible loss of information while ruling out the actions from the CSP. It is about the parallelism constraints: in the example of Figure 13, because actions \alpha and \alpha' are clearly conflicting the row corresponding to the action pair (\alpha,\alpha') is added in the negative table and, as stated "There is only one row in this table listing the values for the variables. During search this combination of variables and values will be avoided". Now suppose, in the domain, we have an additional action \alpha'' that permits this transition, for instance an action \alpha'':
preconds: v1=1, v2=5, v3=2,       v5=6
effects:              v3=3, v4=4, v5=7
I see a risk that the application of action \alpha'' will always be forbidden (by the row in the negative table) for the wrong reason that there is somewhere else in the domain a conflicting pair of actions (\alpha and \alpha'). So is the formulation of parallelism constraints not over-constraining the problem? 

Some more minor comments/suggestions:

- The first time DTG is mentioned in the introduction, it would be good to explain the acronym (it is explained in the abstract but doing it in the introduction would not hurt)

- In the end of section 2.4 on Constraint-Based planners, the comparison with CPT is not really fair because CPT is a temporal planner that can handle more general problems. By the way, this raises the question if (and how) the proposed encoding could be extended to temporal planning or at least a limited form of temporal planning as the one handled in CPT ?

- For self-containedness reasons, it could be good to recap / say a bit more how mutex groups are computed in Helmert 2006) as mutex groups seem to help in the approach and I suppose one can dedicate more or less effort to compute more complete mutex groups

Typos / formatting:

- Section 4: in items 1 and 2 of Definition 12, symbols k and k' are not defined, I suppose they denote p_\alpha(v) and e_\alpha(v) respectively ?

- Algorithm 3, line 9: the comment should better be shifted to the left for readability

- p25: Fiqure 12

- p27: Not sure with the procedure is (consistently) called "PrallelismConstraints", is it a typo?

- p31: nevertehless

- Figure 24: The y-axis read "Time in Seconds" whereas it should be "Number of Instances"
