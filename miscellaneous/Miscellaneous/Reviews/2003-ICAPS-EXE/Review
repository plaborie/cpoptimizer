Title of Paper: Incremental Computation of Resource-Envelopes in
Producer-Consumer Models

Authors: T. K. Satish Kumar

Comments to Authors:

The aim of the paper is very relevant: improve the efficiency of
computing resource envelopes by using an incremental version of a
maxflow algorithm.

The main problem is that this work has no real link with plan
execution (except, of course, for the fact that execution usually
requires more efficient (re)solving procedures). I would propose the
author to resubmit this paper to a more appropriate conference or
workshop.

Some comments about the content of the paper:

The notations are sometimes ambiguous (for instance the quantity in
the formula in lemma 2 does not seem to depend on time t whereas it
should) and sometimes defined after being used (for instance D(G) in
lemma 1). In section 4.1, P_new, C_new, ... are never defined and one
is confused with P,C,... and P',C',... The global readability of the
paper could be much improved by choosing better notations and/or fix
the problem with the existing ones.

Lemma 1 is a well known result and its proof could be omitted.

The incremental maxflow algorithm proposed in the paper is based on
augmenting paths but augmenting paths are known to suffer several
limitations and, in particular, there are some pathological cases
where the worst case complexity (proportional to the value of the
flow) is reached. As the quantities f_cons and f_final may be large
even if the topology of the network has not changed a lot, this may
turn out to be a real complexity issue and should be at least evoqued
in the paper.

Confidential Comments to Programme Committee:

This paper is quite interesting but has nothing to do with plan
execution, that's why I recommand its rejection at this workshop.


Overall recommendation [1 - 10] (10 is strongly accept, 1 is reject)
