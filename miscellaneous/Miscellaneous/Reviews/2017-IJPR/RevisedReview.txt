*Comments to the Author
Please give your remarks to the authors. Without this, your review will be cancelled.

In the revised version, the authors carefully (and satisfactorily) addressed all the comments I had on the original version. 
I only have minor comments about the CP method:

- CP Optimizer does not really use the Constraint-Based local search approach described in (Hentenryck and Michel 2009). The main ideas of the search algorithm of CP Optimizer are described in [1]. Note that a more detailed article describing CP Optimizer (in particular covering the modeling concepts and the automatc search) will be published in the Constraint journal [2].

- On p11, when describing the model, I think it would look better if, in the mathematical equations, the keywords (endOf, endBeforeStart, alwaysEqual, noOverlap) were in text formal (using \textrm{...})
- In the objective function formulation (eq. 12), it could be better to use a 'dot' for the product by w_i instead of the brackets
- Also, I think the capacity constraint (eq. 16) should use "cumul^{capacity}" instead of "capacity"
- later, on the same page 11 there is a typo "wram start" -> "warm start"
- at the begining of page 11: ... now becomes a[n] complementary approach ...

In the introduction to section 6, I think you should better say that "The CP method is coded with OPL language in CP Optimizer 12.7.1".
