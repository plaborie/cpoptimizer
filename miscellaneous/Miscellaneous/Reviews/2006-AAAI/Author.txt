If the constraint is open, one can still do a lot to propagate more if
one knows the rules that governs the insertion of new activities in
the schedule (which is the case in planning). For instance, if state A
must be directly followed by state B and then state C and if in the
current schedule, an activity of state A is followed (not directly) by
an activity of type C and no activity of type B currently in the
schedule are possibly between A and C, then, we can infer that an
operator containing an activity of type B must be added between and C.

OK, my comment was more a question than a negative comment on the
paper. I slightly rephrased it.

As said in my comment, the benchmark could easily have been adapted
and the purpose of the benchmark would have been to give an idea of
how the approach scales with problem size and allow to analyse the
influence of the different propagation rules.

The implementaion of the precedence graph is indeed not detailed but
the propagation rules are provided.

DirectlyBefore corresponds to prev edges.
