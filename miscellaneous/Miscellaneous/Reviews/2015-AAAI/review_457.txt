The paper describes an interesting approach to learn objective function coefficients from a set of qualitative and subjective pairwise comparison of solution's quality by some experts. This problem is very relevant, in particular in optimization as often, it is not easy for domain experts to come up with a realistic objective function.

The learning problem is modeled and solved as a Math. Programming problem (LP or MIP). 

The paper really is easily accessible and the presentation is fairly good. 

To the best of my knowledge, the work reported in the paper is original and is a good example how optimization techniques can be applied to a machine learning problem.

The main issue with the paper is the experimental section and, more precisely, the experimental protocol. It seems to be biased because it takes exactly the same "structure" as the one assumed by the approach: for instance the existence of boundaries for each expert that do not depend on the pair of solutions being compared or the expert rating measured as a function of the difference between objective values (Ok, some random noise is added here but it does not really change the structure of the "model" of the expert. And also, the possibility to handle a basis function selection certainly helps here to overcome this linear scale). In the end, it is not surprising that the proposed approach behaves better than the 2 baselines. Stated otherwise, the proposed approach relies on a particular "model" of the behavior of the expert for comparing solutions. The paper finds "optimal" coefficients based on this model but does not really question the adequacy of this model of the expert behavior (although this model sounds reasonable). A real evaluation on a particular problem with real experts would definitively help strengthening the experimental study, but I understand this is probably out of the scope of the present paper.

Another limitation of the current approach is that it currently handles a single objective function. I'm surprised that the possibility to handle multi-objective is not even mentioned. Many real optimization problems involve multi-objective and sometimes aggregating all the objectives in a weighted sum does not really make sense and the users would like to get several solutions. It seems to me the proposed approach could quite naturally be extended to multi-objective, just be allowing an additional comparative degree "not comparable" for the experts. Part of the outcome of the learning, beside the objective weights, could then be a partition of the objective variables x_k into several objectives.

I'm suggesting to accept the paper because even if it leaves some important questions open, it is an interesting starting point.

More detailed comments:

- The "strong capabilities" of MP (here: LP and MIP) are mentioned several times in the paper. It is not clear what it means. Is it the strong "modeling" capabilities or the strong "solving" capabilities. It seems to me it is more the "solving" capabilities that are exploited here. Because MIP has a relatively limited expressiveness for the objective function (weighted sum), compared to Constraint Programming for instance where you could use any algebraical expression (but probably at the expense of a less efficient solving capability).

- In section 2 maybe you should mention that the experts can contradict each other on the comparison of 2 solutions. It becomes clear in the rest of the paper that the approach can handle that and it clearly is an advantage of the proposed approach.

- In section 2, 3rd point. A typo: j is missing "solution i is far better than solution j".

- The section 6. Typo: "For baseline 2, there is only one estimated boundary ...". I think you mean baseline 1 here.

- Just below: "For baseline 1 and 2, not a few sample points are located beyond ...": you probably mean "note". Furthermore, this is also true for the proposed method, for instance there is a blue point for expert 2 on figure 1 beyond its boundary.
