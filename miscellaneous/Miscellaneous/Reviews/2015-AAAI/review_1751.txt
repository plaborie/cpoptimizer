The main contribution of the paper is an encoding of temporal planning problems into classical planning. Two encodings are proposed in fact:
1- An encoding for general temporal planning problems (plus a small extension of state representation to handle temporal constraint in the form of a STN).
2- An extension of the above encoding in the case where required concurrency is only due to single hard envelopes. In these case some completeness results are provided.

I think the paper advances the state-of-the-art in the domain of temporal planning compilation into classical planning. 

The paper is generally well written but a few points would deserve some clarifications:

1. The second reason for incompleteness of the general encoding (p4, top of column 1) is not clear: "the fact that the planner only tracks the state on fluents, potentially causing lifted temporal states to be incorrectly pruned. Since the state on fluents does not include the STN, the planner may decide not to open a lifted temporal state that would have led to a solution". I understand that the absence of STN may lead to a weaker pruning of the nodes (and thus potentially to an unsound search) but why is it related with incompleteness ? May be a small example would help.

2. More generally, you present the approach as being an implementation of the TEMPO algorithm but as suggested by the (in)completeness results it is clear that the two approaches are different. I understand that the underlying idea under the present paper is that as much as possible of the temporal aspects of the TEMPO algorithm should be delegated to a classical planner through action compilation and this may go with sacrificing completeness in some cases. But I would not call it an "implementation" of the TEMPO algorithm.

3. In the section about the compilation of single hard envelopes, you mention that the approach is incomplete in the general case. You show that the approach is sound and complete in special cases. But what about soundness in the general case? 

4. In the experimental section, the difference between solvers TP and TP' is not clear enough as TP also use compilation of single hard envelopes. Does TP use TP' ? What does TP' for problems that do not have single hard envelopes ? Also, on Table 1, the "accumulated makespan" is nor defined. I suppose it is the sum of the solutions makespan but then this measure can be used only to compare two planners that are able to solve the same instances and this is an information we cannot get from the table. I suggest you at least give on the table the total number of instances of each domain so that one can compare the solution quality at least for the solvers that sole all the instances of a given domain.

The approach compiling single hard envelopes seems very specific and fragile. I understand it can be ok on the IPC competition benchmarks but I have some doubts about its robustness in general. First, it is expected to work well (and be complete, and probably also sound) only in case of single hard envelopes but also the number of fluents grows (quadratically) with the duration of the actions. But it is probably, indeed, a good strategy to use opportunistically when it turns out a problem falls in this category.

A small remark on the propagation of the STN during the search. I think you can do it much faster than running a Floyd-Warshall algorithm because you are not interested in maintaining the delays on all pairs but only in checking the consistency of the network (no negative cycle). See for example [1] for an easy to implement incremental algorithm.
