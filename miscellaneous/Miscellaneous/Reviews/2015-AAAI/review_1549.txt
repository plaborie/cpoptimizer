The paper addresses the problem of computing efficient orderings of sequential portfolios. This problem is very relevant and the approach proposed in the paper is interesting.

My main problem with the paper is the quality of the presentation that makes it very difficult to understand the approach in detail. In particular, the input of the algorithm is never clearly described. As far as I understand, the input of the problem is a set of instances, a set of individual solvers together with their run time and for each pair (instance, (solver,runtime)) a function of time describing the performance of the solver over time (0 <= time <= runtime ?) on this instance (in terms of coverage or overall quality). Is that right? In the paper there is mention of the set of solutions R_si obtained when running a solver s on an instance i (and this set is used in the description of the optimal approach) but is it really only a set of solutions? Does it also include the performance functions ?

On the same line, Figure 1 makes it clear that different orderings of the same portfolio lead to different performance over time. But the link with the functions f_\rho,\tau is not clear. You say "The performance of solvers and portfolios are functions defined over time. Thus, these functions can be seen as density functions": how exactly are these function over time defined ? how can a performance function be homogeneous with a probability density function which is something that is normalized ... In the end, are you looking for an ordering of the solvers that minimizes the area under the curves as the ones shown on Figure 1 (it seems to me it is the case, and it would make sense but I can figure it out from the definitions 5 and 6).

These missing connections makes the understanding of the optimal approach very difficult, even though I understand that the approach works in the space of partial sequences of solvers with a fixed prefix used to compute g(m) and a relaxed heuristic h(m) for the possible completion of the sequence.

Some more detailed comments:

- Do you think your approach could be adapted to the generation of a portfolio ordering for a new problem instance? As far as I understand, the proposed approach assumes that the performance function of each solver is known on the instance. In this sense, this is some kind of post-mortem analyze. Do you have some idea how the proposed approach could be adapted to come up with an efficient static ordering (before solve) for an unknown instance (typically based on instance features) ? It probably involve dealing the uncertain solver performance functions.

- Is it important that the time is considered as discrete ? From my understanding, all the algorithms work by combining areas so I don't think it would be a problem to handle continuous time.

- I understand that the current approach does not play on the time allocated to each solver. Would it make sense to also let the configuration algorithm decide on the allocated time ?

- The greedy heuristic search could probably be improved by doing some sort of local search on the ordering. Did you try something like that ?
