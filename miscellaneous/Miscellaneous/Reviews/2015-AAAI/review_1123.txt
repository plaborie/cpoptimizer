The paper handles the problem of providing some relaxations for over-constrained cc-PSTP. The problem is very relevant as in real applications, problems are often over-constrained and providing explanations for infeasibility together with automatic or user-guided relaxations is necessary.

The paper build on two previous work: (Fang, C.; Yu, P.; and Williams, B. AAAI-2014, definition of the cc-pSTP framework) and (Yu, P.; Fang, C.; and Williams, B. ICAPS 2014, about providing relaxations). 

The description of the motivations and the problem statement is quite clear. What is less clear to me is the description of the approach and in particular, Algorithm 1 and its relation with the rest of the description of the approach. 

For instance, you start with an initial candidate that has no relaxation at all. So by assumption as the general problem is over-constrained, this initial candidate cc-pSTP is infeasible. I understand that the classical resolution of cc-pSTP is to allocate the global risk on each probabilistic duration in order to come up with an STNU. But what happens in the case the original cc-pSTP is infeasible like here? Can you still do this risk allocation and come up with a (clearly not controllable) STNU ? In this context, what do you loose by committing to a particular allocation of risk on each probabilistic duration ?

Then "CDCR first dequeues the best candidate and checks if it resolves all known conflicts". But in the beginning there are no known conflicts so what happens ?

It is also not clear how the "three major procedures" you mention (conflict detection, risk allocation and constraint relaxation) relate with the functions in Algorithm 1 (UnresolvedConflict(...), ExpandOnConflict(...)). Even if one guess later that "Conflict Learning from Controllability Checking" is related with UnresolvedConflict(...) that is, detecting conflicts on the current STNU and that "Risk Allocation and Constraint Relaxation" is related with ExpandOnConflict(...) that is providing relaxations for the detected conflict.

In the section about experimental results, it would be informative to have an idea of the number of test cases that are actually infeasible without relaxation and for these infeasible problems, an idea of the quality of the proposed relaxations (degree of relaxation of the chance constraint and/or temporal constraints). Otherwise, if to take some extreme cases it could be that all the test cases are feasible or that the proposed relaxation are so weak that they do not really make sense (e.g. relax the chance constraint to Delta=1). The experiments do not really show the quality of the relaxations.

I don't think the paper can be considered as an easily accessible paper as it at least requires some reasonably deep understanding of the above mentioned AAAI-2014 and ICAPS-2014 recent papers.

More detailed comments:

- In definition of cc-pSTP (definition 1): is it not allowed to have a controllable temporal constraints between an uncontrollable event (e.g. the eruption) and a controllable one (e.g. departure from the site). You mention this type of precedence in the example on Figure 1, but it does not seem to be (at least directly) allowed in the cc-pSTP formalism.

I must say I don't feel very easy and confident with my rating of this paper. The work is an incremental work on top of recent works (Fang, C.; Yu, P.; and Williams, B. AAAI-2014, definition of the cc-pSTP framework) and (Yu, P.; Fang, C.; and Williams, B. ICAPS 2014, about providing relaxations). I'm not a specialist in STNU and didn't know these recent papers. I read them both but I don't think I have enough hindsight to fairly estimate the significance of this incremental step.
