Summary of the paper:

The paper describes a CP approach to schedule the solar array operations on the international space station. This problem is not new, it was introduced and formalized in the ICKEPS Challenge track at ICAPS-2012 [Frank 2012]. Unlike the current approach (SACE) to solve this problem that is not complete and not guaranteed to find an optimal global solution, the proposed approach is claimed to be complete and able to provide a globally optimal solution.

Summary of the reviews:

The reviewers acknowledge the interest of the approach using CP techniques on a global model of the problem and on the use of a lexicographical method to solve it given the structure of the objective function. 
They also raise several issues with the current version of the article:
- The description of the CP model is not clear enough to get a good understanding of its complexity. Some constraints are not described enough in detail and there are no clear indication of the size of the problem that is being solved in terms of number of variables / constraints
- The readability of the paper should be improved (English, non-homogeneous terminology)
- The experimental section of the paper is difficult to interpret
- In the end, the proposed approach is using very classical ideas (simple constraints, tree search with classical variable selection heuristics, lexicographical resolution a-la goal-programming). This is not a problem in itself (as the paper is more an application paper) but it is to be considered in conjunction with the items above

Personal opinion about the paper:

Using a CP approach on a global model of the problem clearly makes sense for this application. And given the nature of the objective function, a resolution strategy based on a lexicographical ordering of the different criteria is adapted.

I think one of the main issue with the paper is its lack of clarity. I admit that the page limit for IJCAI makes it difficult to non-ambiguously describe a model, a search strategy and an experimental study on a complex problem like the one studied here. But it is difficult to identify the real contribution of the paper. Is it:
- an interesting problem (but the problem itself was already published in Frank-2012)
- a smart modeling of the problem as a CSP (maybe, although at first sight, the resulting model seems to be quite straightforward)
- an original use of techniques to solve the problem (a lexicographical approach makes sense but is it not using too local criteria?, see comment below)
- a convincing experimental study (but the one in the paper is not very clear)
I think the paper does not really answer these questions. Maybe the IJCAI format just does not allow enough space for developing these topics. I would suggest the authors to submit an improved version of the paper to a conference or workshop with a larger page limit.

Some more detailed comments:

The paper is missing some details about the constraints in the CP model. As the problem was already described in Frank-2012, it should be possible to save some space in the description of the problem, for instance Figure 2 could be removed. 

Beside the table constraints for the so-called colors, the model seems to be using quite a lot of meta-constraints (like ct1 \/ ct2) which would probably benefit from a more dedicated propagation (like suggested by the first reviewer).

I don't find the search strategy really innovative. From my experience, most of the real applications of CP (at least as far as planning and scheduling are involved) are solved using a lexicographical approach and that is why industrial CP solvers now integrate concepts such as lexicographical objectives or warm-start to exploit the assignments of the n-1th solution in the nth search (instead of starting from scratch with just the objective cut like done here). The lexicographical approach described in the paper looks a bit naive as it seems to restart from scratch (except for the cases optimality is already proved thanks to the LB) and each iteration explores a unique search tree with basic variable orderings and branching schemes.

The authors did not comment on the second reviewer remark about giving some typical indications on the model like the number of variable/constraints so it is very difficult to assess the complexity of the problem. 

In the description of the criteria in the beginning of section 4, I'm surprised that these criteria are so "local". In the criteria vector there seem to be, not only one criterion per type (C,M,D,L) but also per configuration (i) and sides (s). So there does not seem to be 4 criteria but a myriad of them (well at least 4x4x2?) and if the ordering according to the types makes sense from an application point of view, the ordering inside a given type seems purely arbitrary whereas they probably should be aggregated (as they are in the table 1 as "average value in final plans"). This seems to lead to non-optimal global solutions (with respect to the user's expectations) whereas global optimality is one of the claim of the approach.

In the table, I do not get why the "Perpendicular" method which is described as being similar to SACE (so the "Greedy" method) but being not greedy turns out to produce much worse solutions whereas in my understanding, it should produce better results.

Summary of review
-----------------------------

The paper describes a CP approach to schedule the solar array operations on the international space station; this problem was described in Frank-2012. Using a CP approach on a global model of the problem with a resolution strategy based on a lexicographical ordering of the different criteria clearly makes sense for this application. One of the main issue with the paper is that it is difficult to assess its contribution because it is missing too much details. I would suggest the authors to submit an improved version of the paper to a conference or workshop with a larger page limit.

Comments:

Thanks Jean-Guillaume. I agree with you that an application paper does not need to advance the state-of-the-art in the techniques it is using. It is completely enough to bring out a new interesting and challenging problem and/or an original use-case of known techniques. Here the paper does not contribute with a new application as the problem was already published in Frank-2012. And, from my point of view, it is a bit short on the other possible contribution due to a conjunction of poor writing quality, lack of precision and no real originality in the resolution approach.

I agree with all of you that the paper is missing some details about the constraints in the CP model. Beside the table constraints for the so-called colors, it seems to be using quite a lot of meta-constraints (like ct1 \/ ct2) which would probably benefit from a more dedicated propagation (like suggested by Pierre).

The authors did not comment on Eric's remark about giving some typical size of the models so it is very difficult to assess the complexity of the problem. My gut feeling is that the instances they solve may not be as challenging as it seems.

In the description of the criteria in the beginning of section 4, I'm surprised that these criteria are so "local". In the criteria vector there seem to be, not only one criterion per type (C,M,D,L) but also per configuration (i) and sides (s).

Also, in the table, I do not get why the "Perpendicular" method which is described as being similar to SACE (so the "Greedy" method) but being not greedy turns out to produce much worse solutions whereas in my understanding, it should produce better results.

For me, the paper has too many shortcomings to make it (I do not even mention the English and the ambiguous terminology (e.g. side/group, is it the same notion?)). What do you think?
