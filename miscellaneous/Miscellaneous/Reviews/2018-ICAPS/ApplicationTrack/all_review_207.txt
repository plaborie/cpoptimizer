This paper presents different suboptimal strategies for planning acquisition by a 2D imaging sensor of an agile satellite of areas decomposed in tiles that can be fully acquired in one orbit pass. The authors explain they look only at suboptimal solutions after noting that the optimization problem is at least NP-hard and thus intractable. They also attempt to adapt a pushbroom algorithm initially designed for 1D imaging sensors but empirical evaluation shows evidence of poor performances in comparison to the proposed algorithms dedicated to 2D imaging sensors.

All the presented variants are based on the decomposition of the area to image in contiguous tiles on which grid planning algorithms are run to plan for the minimal makespan ordering acquisition of the tiles by taking account for constraints on acquisition, slewing and generally motion times. The authors show that naive fixed grid and plans are not satisfactory because the deformation of the projected observed area due to the motion of the satellite during acquisition modifies the grid thus invalidating the initial plan. They propose effective replanning algorithms that continuously rebuild (replanning sidewinder) or repair (online frontier repair) the plan along with the deformation of the grid after each action. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of these two online replanning algorithms over the other variants on hard benchmarks. Additional experiments are conducted to assess the sensibility of the planning problem to the degree of agility or to local optimization refinements.

One problem of this paper is its lack of formalization. Except the formal problem statement, most other parts (including algorithms) are only described by words that make it difficult for the reader to perfectly understand the technical aspects of the paper. The authors argue that the tackled problem is especially hard due to time-dependent tile values and cost to slew between tiles, but no formalization supports this argument later in the paper (e.g. algorithms) nor it makes possible for non expert readers to apprehend this issue. Moreover, the authors use technical words related to the application that are often not defined but in the cited papers which also does not help understanding the paper at first read (one example among others: "strip scan rate" can be roughly understood by intuition but a definition is needed to clearly understand the whole sentence where it is used).

Another issue of the paper is the relative lack of structure of the contribution, especially in the "Approximation Planning Algorithms" section. The authors present a sequence of variants to solve the tour problem which appear to be a bit rambling. Perhaps a few sentences at the beginning of the section explaining the logical chaining of the presented algorithms would consolidate the contribution.

The NP-hardness of the problem is not formally demonstrated, which is a shame in my opinion because it is the main argument in favor of the suboptimal algorithms presented, all the more so as more than 1 column is available at the end of the paper for additional contents within the allowed room. More generally this available room could have been used to formalize the proposed concepts and algorithms.

I would also have appreciated an empirical comparison of the proposed algorithms with Knight's concentric ring tiling algorithm which appears to be one of the only alternative to this paper's contribution.

Questions for the rebuttal:

1. The authors present the problem as a scheduling one but it seems to involve only a sequence of time-dependent actions which falls rather in the field of temporal planning without parallel actions. Are there parallel actions in the studied problem?

2. "Once the partial tour is exhausted, the next layer is planned": which layer are we speaking about? Is there a hierarchical planner used here and if so, how?

DISCUSSION AFTER REBUTTAL:

Dear all,

The authors' response is fine but formalizing the algorithms and comparing against Knight's concentric ring algorithm as they promise would change the paper so much that I find too risky to accept the paper on the basis of these hypothetical changes (which are yet needed). So I still vote for rejectiob.

Concerning their answer to my question about the sequential aspect of their problem that makes it relevant more to the temporal planning community than to the scheduling one, their problem seems to be closer to hybrid task/spatial robotic planing problems than to scheduling problems in general. In any case it is not a scheduling problem, or at least it is but with only 1 timeline... not sure the presentation in the paper helps realizing it.

Best,
Florent

This paper considers the problem of activity planning for Earth observing satellites equipped with 2D framing sensors. It presents eight strategies for dealing with such a problem, including strategies based on a fixed discretization (a fixed grid), or late-committing strategies which decide on tour points at scheduling time. Last, it compares these strategies, for instance in terms of CPU time and makespan. Globally, this paper tackles an important practical application, and the novelty of this application (2D framing sensors) is clearly stated. The optimization problem tackled is technically difficult, since for instance the footprint of the 2D instrument changes in size and shape depending on the observation time. From my point of view, the main drawback of the paper is a lack of clarity and formalization at several places. The authors could have presented fewer strategies but with more details.

=== Detailed comments ===

In the first steps of the formalization, the authors should describe more formally the components of a valid observation (r_obs,r_tgt,\theta,t), by saying that "r" denotes a position, that \theta denotes a rotation angle around the camera pointing direction (?), and by giving for instance the reference frame used for the positions. Moreover, it is not fully clear to me why r_obs must be specified to define an observation because it is functionally dependent on the observation time (given the fixed orbit of the agile satellite). Additionally, formalizations such as "footprint images ... have sufficient overlap" are too vague. 

Then, several parts of the different strategies are hard to follow:
- For the "Pushbroom" strategy, the meaning of "the fastest end of the observer agility envelope and largest sensor footprint" is unclear to me.
- For "Regular grid" and TSP approaches, there exist many local search techniques or metaheuristics which are fast and more efficient than simple insertion heuristic. It is not clear to me whether the authors only used greedy insertion heuristics.
- For the "Sidewinder" strategy, why are the different lines of the instrument boresight path not parallel in Figure 8b?
- The "Perimeter tour" strategy is really unclear to me. I thought I understood something from the description, but my understanding is not consistent with the example provided in Figure 8d. A more precise formalization of the problem would probably have helped to define this strategy in a non-ambiguous way, for example concerning notions such as "area score" or concerning the "layer" concept mentioned in the strategy.
- The precise technical details behind the "Replanning sidewinder" strategy are also hard to grasp, especially concerning the way taboo tiles are dealt with, and the example of Figure 6 did not help me to precisely understand the approach.
- For the "Online frontier repair" strategy, the method used for repairing the current observation plan is not provided.

=> Please indicate in the author feedback how these clarity issues could be solved.

For several strategies, it seems that the orientation parameter (orientation of the camera around the pointing direction) is not really exploited to try and build shorter plans. For example, depending on the shape of the observation area and on the observer field of view, it might be more interesting to observe the area using the observer oriented in a particular way around the camera pointing axis.

Last, as mentioned in the conclusion, the approach is especially useful when the target area is not small relative to the imager footprint. However, in the case of very large areas, it will not necessarily be possible even for a very agile satellite to observe the full area within a single overflight, and it is not fully clear how this case will be handled by the authors.

Other comments:
- p3: "how to" => how
- Table 1: what do you mean by "354x1450" for the orbit altitude?
- "Related Work" section: the precise link with the works mentioned in the last paragraph is unclear to me.

DISCUSSION AFTER REBUTTAL:

I am also keeping my weak reject recommendation after the author feedback. There are just too many points to be addressed concerning the presentation and the formalization, and the paper would require another reviewing round to be sure that it can be publishable.

This paper presents and evaluates algorithms for scheduling step and stare tile based observations that cover a target region in a single over flight of an earth observing satellite. The paper starts with a description of the evolution of earth observing from push broom to step and stare tile based observing. The problem domain is then formally described and a series of algorithms are sketched which approximate optimal solutions. Finally an evaluation of the algorithms is presented using two realistic observing scenarios. 

The initial sections of the paper are dominated by a discussion of the move from push broom to tile based observing strategies. This focus seems more suitable to a conference on earth observing as opposed to a paper in a general planning and scheduling conference. The paper would be stronger providing more details on the problem at hand and not the evolution of earth observing. 

The level of detail presented in the paper seems uneven. The descriptions of the different step-stare tiling algorithms are quite sparse and would not allow a researcher to duplicate the algorithms. In contrast, details about the experimental setup are provided in tables 1 and 2 that do not obviously add to understanding the results. I doubt these are the full set of parameters that STK needs to model the observing constraints. If so the authors should make it explicit. If not then why are these parameters presented and not others? Again the details presented might be more relevant to the earth observing community as opposed to a general planning and scheduling audience.

The evaluation section of the paper is relatively strong. The evaluation shows that dynamic scheduling approaches become more valuable as the problem gets harder. While this is not surprising it is valuable to show and would allow missions to make tradeoffs between runtime and observing efficiency as required by the mission parameters.

DISCUSSION AFTER REBUTTAL:

While I feel that the proposed changes would make the paper much stronger, I feel that the changes are too large in scope to accept without another round of review. So I will stay with a -1 evaluation

COMMENT

It seems that we all agree. 
I'll write a meta-review recommending the rejection because of the lack of formalism and the complexity of the paper for non-specialists in earth observation.
But that it is by no mean an assessment of the technically quality of the work that is described here, as we believe this is a relevant and significant work. 

Also, feel free to update your reviews after the authors feedback.

META-REVIEW:

Recommendation: Reject

Metareview (*):

There is a strong convergence of the reviewers opinion on the paper.

The main issue is that the paper is missing some formal details about the problem and the approach and that the use of many unexplained technical terms related with the earth observing application makes it very difficult to understand for a general planning & scheduling practitioner.

Note that this is by no mean an assessment of the technically quality of the work, as all reviewers believe this is a relevant and significant piece of work. 

In its current form, the article would better suit a conference on earth observation. This work could also be presented at a general planning and scheduling conference like ICAPS but this would require some rewriting and rebalancing of the paper in order to extract from the application a standalone mathematical description of the problem and of the proposed approaches/algorithms. This may require some additional space in the paper, but some space can be saved by providing less details in the initial section (a suggested by reviewer 4) and maybe describing fewer strategies (a suggested by reviewer 3).
