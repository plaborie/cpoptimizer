The paper describes a greedy polynomial time algorithm for solving a
particular type of processor instruction scheduling problem.

The proposed algorithm for computing lower and upper bounds on
instruction execution time is original (it take both resource
capacities and delays between tasks into account) and seem to produce
tight bounds. This is of course at the expense of the computational
complexity which is in O(n^3).

My main issue with the paper is that if the principles of the
algorithm are quite simple, the details are difficult to follow
(sections Forward Scheduling and Backward Scheduling, The
Predecessor-Successor-Tree-Bound Consistency). I think this detailed
description should be simplified by focusing on 'what' the algorithm
is computing rather than on 'how' it computes it. From this
perspective, some figures would be helpful. 

The links between the different parts of the detailed description are
not clear. For instance a pseudo-code for the backward-scheduling
procedure that is used by the main consistency algorithm is given but
this algorithm is not re-used in the pseudo-code of the main
consistency algorithm in the following section. Another example: 2 key
procedures are mentioned after the pseudo-code of the main consistency
algorithm but are not clearly identified in this pseudo code. Same
thing for the 2 steps for computing the smallest start time of vi in
all relaxed problem instances Pred(P,vi). It is not clear why the
backward scheduling procedure is not just the mirror image of the
forward scheduling one.

The experimental section is missing some details, in particular, how
the CPU time of the proposed approach compare with the one of Wu et al
otherwise, it is difficult to compare the two approaches. 

Some more detailed comments:

- In the abstract, the description mentions a parameter 'e' but this
parameter is not used in the complexity formula.

- In "Problem and Definitions", it is mentioned that if an instruction
has no pre-assigned deadline, one is computed using the largest
pre-assigned deadline. This seems to artificially over-constrain the
problem, why is this needed?

- In definition 1: {vj : vj \in Succ(vi)} can be simplified as
Succ(vi) !

- When first reading Definition 8, one really wonder how to compute
the smallest start time t'i that is mentioned. This is of course the
purpose of the proposed algorithm so the definition does not seem
self-contained. The first point should be rephrased.

- In section Forward and Backward Scheduling, the notion of
'independent instructions' is used but not explicitly defined.

- Just below: "a set of independent of instructions"

- In the pseudo-code, there seem to be a problem with notations:
according to the definition, dj is not an interval but a value and in
the 'while' loop, is is used as an interval (djs.limit).

- In the next section, in the pseudo-code for the main consistency
algorithm, it seems strange that the condition for continuing the
'while' loop is 'quit=1'.
