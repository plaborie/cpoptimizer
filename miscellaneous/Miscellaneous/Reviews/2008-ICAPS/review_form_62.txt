*** TITLE: Spatio-temporal scheduling: A fixed-parameter tractable
    algorithm for the prize-collecting travelling salesman problem
    with time windows

*** REVIEW:

---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The paper describes a spatio-temporal scheduling problem
(prize-collecting TSPs with time-windows) and proposes a fixed
parameter tractable algorithm to solve it.

The positioning of the paper is not clear: 
- the theoretical contribution (the fixed parameter tractable
complexity of the proposed algorithm) is, in my opinion, not
significant enough to justify by itself the acceptance at ICAPS given
that the density criterion was already identified in [Bar-Yehuda et
al] as a key aspect of the complexity of the problem; and
- the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithm is not supported
by any theoretical or experimental comparison with alternative
approaches (complete approaches such as constraint programming or
local-search and other meta-heuristics for quickly obtaining
high-quality solutions are I think good alternatives for tackling this
problem). When the sequence length is small one can indeed expect
constraint propagation to efficiently prune the search space and many
moves can be filtered in local search. The paper could be strengthened
by providing such an experimental study.

Further comments:

- In the abstract, the claim that most scheduling algorithms consider
only the temporal component of a scheduling problem should be somehow
softened. For instance, an important part of the scheduling literature
is about problems dealing with sequence dependent setup times, these
setup times are often due to spatial constraints (transportation
times). In a similar line, scheduling problems involving resources
with spatial constraints (robots in jobshop environments, quay cranes,
etc.) is an active domain in the scheduling community. And, by the
way, not all these spatio-temporal problems can be seen as variants of
TSPs.

- p2, col2: typo: "over the the alphabet"

- In the discussion, both mentioned extensions of temporal constraints
(Temporal CSPs and Allen algebra) change the complexity of the purely
temporal problem from polynomial to NP-complete. My feeling is that
the proposed approach whose efficiency relies on the tightness of
time-windows may not be robust with respect to this type of extension.
