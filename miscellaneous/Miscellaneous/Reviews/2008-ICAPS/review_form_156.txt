*** REVIEW FORM ID: 97758::46681
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 156
*** TITLE: CircuitTSAT: A Solver for Large Instances of the Disjunctive Temporal Problem
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie

*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The paper proposes a direct encoding of the Disjunctive Temporal
Problem (DTP) in SAT by representing integer time-variables as a
bitset of log2(Q) boolean variables (if Q is the largest value of
time-variables). Temporal constraints y-x<=z are directly encoded as
SAT clauses on the boolean variables. The approach has been
implemented and shown to be efficient for large feasible DTPs.

To the best of my knowledge, this approach is original, even if some
attempts have already been made in CSPs to use dichotomical search for
variables with large domains like time-variables. Here, the
originality (and maybe also one of the limitation because this is
difficult to generalize to other constraints) of the approach is that
the constraints on time-variables are directly encoded on the boolean
variables.

The paper is clearly written and well organized.  

A few detailed remarks: 

- in section "Representing STCs using Circuits", in the first
paragraph it should be clearly stated that q must be at least equal to
log2(Q) where Q is the max domain value in order the representation to
be exact.

- in the same section, it is surprising one focus on Y-X<=0 whereas
the general form of temporal constraints are Y-X<=z. This is only
explained in the section "Concerting STCs to CNF Efficiently". It
would be good to say something about it at this point.

- in the section about experimental results, the series of figure 2
are really difficult to read because there are so many curves. Maybe
some values for problem size could be avoided.

- All the large problems in the generated set are feasible (as
CircuitTSAT finds a solution for 100% of them). It would be
interesting to see if how the approach compares with TSAT++ and Yices
on large problems that are infeasible or where the density of
solutions is smaller. Did you try some more structured instances ?
