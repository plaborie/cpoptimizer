-- CP 2011 Review Instructions
--
-- While there is no imposed format for the writing, your
-- review is expected to provide comments to justify your
-- scores in each category: namely, OVERALL ASSESSMENT,
-- SIGNIFICANCE, NOVELTY, TECHNICAL QUALITY, PRESENTATION,
-- and RELEVANCE.  You are also welcome to furnish additional
-- comments to help authors improve the paper.
--
-- A note about short paper submissions: Short papers are for
-- "smaller" piece of work with less amount of new materials,
-- but not lesser quality.  The same standard will be applied
-- in reviewing them (significance, novelty, technical
-- quality, presentation, relevance).  Short papers should 
-- describe still a fairly mature piece of work, and not 
-- initial ideas or incomplete work.
--
-- Both long and short paper submissions will only be accepted
-- or rejected.  No long paper submissions will be accepted as
-- a short paper.

-- Be nice and constructive.

In the current state the scheduling problem solved by the CP approach 
does not seem very expressive as it is mainly disjunctive resources together 
with P/A graphs and an earliness/tardiness cost. In section 4.1, there is a 
justification for this "light" constraint model that assumes the real-life 
features of applications can be compiled into this light constraint model. 
It is not clear how some classical scheduling elements one finds in many 
real applications such as cumulative or replenishable resources, activities 
with variable processing time (with a possible impact on the cost), activities 
that can be suspended by calendars, complex synchronization between activities 
start and end time that goes beyond simple precedence constraints, setup-times on 
machines, etc. can be compiled into the proposed model. It would be good to 
elaborate on this compilation. 

There is nothing really new concerning the P/A model already presented in 
earlier papers. The "pro-active" propagation was also described in earlier 
papers [7] as well as in other similar approaches such as [17]. 
The search strategy is also not really new as the SST has been described 
in other papers and the PCP corresponds for instance to the "Rank First/NotFirst" 
branching scheme used in Constraint-Based Scheduling such as in ILOG Scheduler 
(see for instance AIPS 2002 tutorial "Constraint-Based Scheduling in an
A.I. Planning and Scheduling Perspective").

Concerning the second part of the search about fixing dates, solving the STN with 
convex cost functions (like the earliness/tardiness used in the model) is known 
to be polynomially solvable (see [Chretienne&Sourd-2003]) so what is the reason 
to use a CP search tree to branch on this problem? Furthermore, in the case of 
the earliness/tardiness function used in the paper the problem could be solved 
very efficiently to optimality with a linear program.

[Chretienne&Sourd-2003] Chretienne, P., and Sourd, F. 2003. Pert scheduling 
with convex cost functions. Theor. Comput. Sci. 292(1):145–164.

The search strategy seems to consist of a simple search tree exploration. 
Is it really enough to ensure good quality solutions are produced in reasonable 
time? This type of search alone is known to suffer from the fact early decisions 
cannot be changed until the full subtree below has been explored so they need very 
good heuristics to guide variable and value selection. Those heuristics are usually  
difficult to get, especially when the problem is complex and has been compiled into 
a "low level" CP model that somehow lost the semantics of the business model. 

It would be useful to have some (even general) information about the different
applications where the presented CP approach was used and what were their principal 
characteristics (type of P/A network topology, size of the problem in terms of 
activities/resources, expectations of the customer, etc.).
