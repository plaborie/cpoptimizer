The paper proposes a meta-heuristic based on Local Search and Path Relinking for the 
Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem With Sequence Dependent Setup Times. 

The problem can be considered as a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with 
vehicles=machines and visits=jobs. The difference with classical VRP is that duration of 
visits and travel times depend on the vehicle (but those are classical extensions of VRP) 
and that the objective is makespan rather than travel time minimization. 

Most of what is described in the paper is classically used in meta-heuristics for VRPs:
- local search with moves like relocation of visits in vehicle routes which are extensively 
used in the VRP literature. The incremental computation of cost as described in the paper 
is one of the foundation of the effectiveness of quick move evaluation in VRP local search. 
I think that other neihborhoods like 2-opt or cross-exchange that exhange longer part of 
the routes would also make sense in the current scheduling problem.
- variable neighborhood search is successful for this type of problem because the different 
nature of neighborhoods increase the connectivity of the search space. See Hansen2003 for a 
review of these techniques in the context of VRP.
- path relinking is also quite usual in this context. See for instance Ho2006.

So it is not really surprising that the proposed meta-heuristics works well on this type of 
problem. I think it would be necessary to link the scheduling problem studied in this paper 
and the proposed approach to the work on VRPs. 

Some parts of the paper are very difficult to understand because the formulation is not 
clear. This is especially true for the section "Initial Solution". It is mentioned there 
that the jobs are sorted in "increasing order of processing times": what does this means 
given that a job is associated with several processing times (one per machine)? The next 
sentence reads "For other jobs": which ones? The procedure for building an initial solution 
seems quite simple but the description is really not clear.
