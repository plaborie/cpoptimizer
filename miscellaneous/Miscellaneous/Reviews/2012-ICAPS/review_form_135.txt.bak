*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The paper describes a very challenging and significant optimization problem in the context of terminal ports that combines berth and quay crane allocation to vessels. After a formal description of the problem, a meta-heuristic search approach is described and evaluated.

The main limitation of the paper is that the approach itself is described in less than one page (section "A Metaheuristic Search") so there is not enough information to get a precise picture of what is going on, especially as far as the local search step is concerned. This part of the paper should be developed. Space could be saved by shortening the introduction and maybe merging the sections about problem description and mathematical formulation. 

When robustness is taken into account, the formulation of the related objective part (equation 8) is a bit strange in that it seems to consider every pair (i,j) of vessel such that j is moored after i, even if some additional vessels are moored in between. Would it not be more natural for robustness to consider an additional security duration for each vessel sh_i such that the actual moored duration would be h_i+sh_i instead of h_i and, in the objective function, balance this security duration with the service time. For robustness this duration should be made as long as possible but as d_i=m_i+h_i+sh_i, departure time d+i will be increased which will increase the service time of the vessel and delay the vessels scheduled after i.  

The comparison with CPLEX is interesting as it gives some lower bound for small problems. Of course, for large problems the comparison does not make much sense because the CPLEX formulation does not scale well when the time horizon is increased. It would be interesting to model the same problem in CP Optimizer (both CPLEX and CP Optimizer are available in IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio). Thanks to the notion of interval variable, CP Optimizer would permit a model that do not require an explicit enumeration of time. 

Note that on Table 1, it is not clear why there are two tables. What is the difference between the upper and lower tables?

It would be very useful if the problem instances used to evaluate the method were made publicly available. In fact, there is almost enough information in the paper to generate instances similar to the ones that were used in the evaluation. The only missing data are the arrival dates for vessels and the quay crane characteristics (maximal number of quay cranes assigned to a vessel, safety distance between quay cranes and number of movements per time unit).

I attach for information a CP Optimizer model that is supposed to model the same problem. An instance is also provided randomly generated for 20 vessels, it uses the information provided in the paper and assumes movsQC=1, maxQC=5 and secQC=40m and all the arrival dates are 0. An initial solution is found very quickly and iteratively improved. It would be interesting to compare it with the meta-heuristic approach described in the paper. The model seem to scale quite well to larger problems (some hundreds of vessels).
