*** REVIEW:

The paper describes and iterative improvement method for solving the blocking job-shop problem.

The ingredients of the approach are:
- A precedence posting method (PCP) for producing resource feasible STPs based on 
  heuristic rules to choose conflict and resolver (most constrained conflict first, 
  priority to least constrained resolver)
- An iterative method based on relaxing and re-optimizing a part of the current STP.
- Relaxed fragments of the STP are selected either randomly or based on the variable slack. 
  The size of the fragment (gamma) is a parameter of the approach.
  
The approach is not really new. Except for the definition of the slack-based selection,
which is the main contribution of the paper, all ingredients above are well known 
individually and have already been used in conjunction like in the Iterative Flattening 
method of Cesta & Oddi. 

In the context of the current problem, the PCP method suffers two problems I think:
- it does not scale well with problem size (this limitation is mentioned in the paper)
- it completely leaves aside many inferences ("dominance conditions" as stated in the 
  paper) that could be performed at each node before branching and which are now commonly 
  used in constrained-based scheduling (not-first/not-last rules, edge-finding) that would 
  help pruning the search space. The only propagation performed by PCP at a given search 
  node is the equivalent of the so called "disjunctive" constraint but this constraint 
  could be propagated more efficiently by considering it as a global constraint rather than 
  by looking and propagating individually each "uniquely resolvable decision".

The experimental study seem to suggest that automatically learning the size and the nature 
(random of slack-based) of the relaxed fragment gamma could help improving the performances 
as depending on the instance, the most efficient value for gamma does not seem to be the 
same. This type of parameter learning is for instance implemented in the method described 
in [1]. 

Although the results compared to the state of the art seem quite good, I have the feeling 
it is mostly because the state of the art is not very strong on this problem. I tried for 
instance to solve this problem with CP Optimizer using the default search parameters [2] 
and, compared to the state of the art, it gives similar results as the ones of the paper 
(more than 20 improved bounds with a single run without parameter change). CP Optimizer 
implements the approach outlined in [1]. I attach the OPL model for information.

I noticed the following typos in the paper:
- p2, section "A CSP Representation": generalized disjuctive graph
- p5, section "Slack-based selection": it seems the waiting time should read 
  wi=-d(ei,si)-pi rather than -d(si,ei)-pi. The current formulae does not make much sense 
  to me.
- in the result tables, there are several occurrences of "0" as makespan value. What does 
  it mean?

------- Rebuttal Questions ------

1) Do you think it would be possible to integrate a comparison with CP Optimizer in the paper ? 
A very naive formulation of the problem for this tool is attached with the review.

2) In the recent years, iterative flattening methods have been successfully applied to a wide range of scheduling problems:
- Multi-capacity job-shop problem: Cesta&al. Iterative Flattening: A Scalable Method for Solving Multi-Capacity Scheduling Problems, AAAI-2000.
- Flexible Job-Shop: Oddi&al. Iterative Flattening Search for the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem. IJCAI-2011.
- Job-shop with setup times: Oddi&al. Exploiting Iterative Flattening Search to Solve Job Shop Scheduling Problems with Setup Times. PlanSIG-2010
- RCPSP:  Oddi&al. Iterative flattening search for resource constrained scheduling. Journal Intell Manuf. 2010.
- RCPSP/MAX: Oddi, Rasconi. Iterative Flattening Search on RCPSP/max Problems: Recent Developments. 2008.
- Paper [1] above, describes an experimental study over 21 classical scheduling problems
What do you think is the contribution of your work to the improvement of iterative flattening methods?
