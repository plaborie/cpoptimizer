========================

I think the authors satisfactorily addressed the issues related with decoding the CSP to build an action plan thanks to the new notion of parallelism variables and I recommend to accept the article.

Maybe the description of why those parallelism variables values (labels) permit exactly to capture the actual individual conflicts between actions (namely I'm speaking of the paragraph starting end of p28 with "We now need to find a way to assign ... ") could be better explained. In particular, it seems that you can generate the same parallelism variable value (label) for two incompatible actions respectively belonging to PAndE(v,k1,k') and PAndE(v,k2,k') for k1!=k2. But this is not a problem as these 2 actions already corresponds to two different rows in the table (because of the state variables, not the parallelism variable). Transitions due to 2 conflicting actions should correspond to 2 rows in the table and parallelism variables are only used to discriminate between those conflicting actions that would otherwise generate the same row in the table. Stated otherwise, the proof that the parallelism variable labels generated by algorithm 5 are necessary and sufficient to discriminate between conflicting actions (that is, that they exactly implement the constraints identified by Lemma 5) could be made more formal.
