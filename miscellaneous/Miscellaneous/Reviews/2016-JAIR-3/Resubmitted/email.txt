Hi Philippe,

Thanks. See the authors response (attached with the paper) for my previous decision
(including the identification of the flaw) and the authors' response.

Please send your review by electronic mail to jcb@mie.utoronto.ca, and CC a
copy to jair-ed@isi.edu. Please include in your review your overall evaluation
of the paper ("accept as is," "accept with minor revisions," or "reject").
As this is the third round of review, these are the only options now.
Normally we will not accept a paper if it requires major revisions.
In addition to your overall evaluation for the editor,
please also include comments and suggestions for the authors.

I look forward to your review by Jan 16, 2017.
Chris
