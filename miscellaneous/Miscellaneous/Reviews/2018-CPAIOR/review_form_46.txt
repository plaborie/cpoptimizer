This is a very interesting article on a challenging real-world problem.

The paper is clearly written and well structured.

My only comments are on the experimental evaluation. 

It would be interesting to see why for some of the largest problems, the RPD of the CP model is so large. Even on some problems where the CP model proves optimality (for instance 2/8/25), the solution at 600s is more than 30 times worse than the optimal solution. This is quite surprising. Is it because the engine has difficulties to find an initial feasible solution? Or because the convergence is slow and with sudden huge improvements ?

If the focus of the experimental study is on optimality proofs the time taken to prove optimality by CP Optimizer may decrease if one increase the focus on proofs using a large value for the parameter FailureDirectedSearchEmphasis (for instance giving a value like half or 3/4 of the number of parallel workers).
