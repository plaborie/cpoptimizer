The article presents a very interesting routing and scheduling appication. The problem is a variant of a pickup and delivery problem with limited vehicle capacities and time windows where the visits are optional. It compares a MIP, a CP and an hybrid model (Logic-based Benders decomposition). In the experimental section, the models are compared on a set of generated datasets as well as on real-world problems and the paper concludes that the standalone CP model performs better.

The main weakness of the paper is that the explanation why CP performs better is not very convincing and/or the related experiments not described with enough details. 

The main argument that is proposed is that CP propagates more than the other approaches. As MIP does not really relies on propagation, this argument makes only some sense for the comparison CP v.s. CP LBBD. In the experiments the impact of propagation (using articial lower bounds) is performed at the root node only. How is this impact measured in the case of CP LBBD? Is it by propagating the lower bound on the CP master problem? But as by definition the CP master problem is a relaxation (less constrained) that the full problem, is it not expected that it will result in less propagation? It seems that the stronger propagation arguments holds for any Full CP v.s. CP-LBBD master problem; independently of which approach works better. Also, the impact of the propagation is measured only in terms of the *number of instances* for which the propagation at the root node did something, independently of *how much* the propagation reduced the domains. From this perspective is is also weird that you introduced a numerical estimation of the search space reduction (in equation 49) but never use it in the experiments.

In fact it could make more sense to analyze the behavior of the standalone CP model that uses CP Optimizer by running independently the two ingredients of the CP Optimizer search (Large-Neighborhood Search LNS and Failure Directed Search FDS) that by default run concurrently. If LNS probably helps quickly finding feasible solutions and improving them until the point it is quasi-optimal, it is pretty sure that it is FDS that is responsible for proving the optimality. The two approaches can be tested individually by playing on the FailureDirectedSearchEmphasis parameter (0 or close to the number of parallel workers). And in this case, more than the stronger propagation, it is probably that the standalone CP model is better than the decomposed model because of the way the different decisions (allocation of visits to vehicles and sequencing of the visits on each vehicle) are taken and interleaved during the search.

The description of the CP model should be clarified. In particular:
- The fact that X_i is a vector of interval variable X_i=[X_i,k]
- When introducing interval variables X_i,k and \overlined{X}_k,i (by the way, is it intended that the order of the index i,k is reversed) you should describe what these variables represent (the pickup and the delivery intervals for a request i by a vehicle k) and also how they are related with the Xi vector in the alternative. Furthermore, the X_i,k (without overline is not used in the model).  In fact, the fact i sometimes denotes a request (thus two locations) and sometimes a location is very misleading.
- The notation GetStartMax / GetEndMax is very ambiguous as it may suggest that it denote a bound on the current domain of the variables. I suppose you mean something like StartOf(...)-EndOf(...).

It could also be interesting to try a variant of the CP model where the transportation time (starting at the start time of x_i,r- and finishing at the end time of x_i,r+) is modeled as an additional interval variable (of length <=F). You could have also one of such optional interval variable representing the transportation time for each vehicle k (with an additional alternative constraint). This model would allow to use a "pulse" for the vehicle load cumul function that should result in stronger inference because the increase/decrease of the cumul function will be better correlated.

Minor comments and typos:
p8: in the last 2 equations (47 and 48), the sets used in r in J_{h,k} are not defined
p9: section 3.4: how do you define the "length" of a request?
p14: last line: "both[e]". Also, you do nt say how you handle the case of the optional intervals in the domain size (optional intervals have an additional value in the domain repreenting the absence of the interval). Or maybe here, as at the root node all interval are optional, this is not really important?
