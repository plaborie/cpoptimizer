Review.

The article extends some meta-heuristics for solving a particular oversubscribed scheduling problem with single machine, time windows and setup times. In particular, it proposes an hybridation of self-adapting LNS and tabu search exploiting the specificities of the problem. The efficiency of the proposed extension is assessed in an experimental section.

Adaptative LNS is now widely used for scheduling. I'm wondering if the authors are aware of [1] which is one of the first paper that introduced ALNS for scheduling problems. The approach originally described in [1] is more general than the ALNS part described in the present paper because it aims at solving general scheduling problems (including cumulative scheduling). It also was generalized to solve (in particular) oversubscribed scheduling problems with the notion of optional interval variables [2] and shown to be very effective compared to specialized algorithms. This ALNS is implemented as a heuristics to guide the exact search of CP Optimizer [3], an optimization engine available since more than 10 years in CPLEX Optimization Studio which is a tool that you used in your experiments so I'm really surprised you did not compare your heuristics against CP Optimizer. The formulation of the problem is just 4 lines long (see below). Given the nature of the problem studied here and the type of proposed resolution approach I think a comparison with CP Optimizer is necessary. 

For instance given the input data:

S  : sequence-dependent setup time matrix
d_i: duration of order i
r_i: revenue of order i
[b_i,e_i]: time window for the start time of order i

Here is a formulation of the problem with CP Optimizer:

maximize sum_{i in [1,n]} r_i * presence_of(o_i)
subject to:
  no-overlap(seq, S)
interval o_i optional size d_i in [b_i,e_i-d_i)    forall i in [1,n]
sequence seq in [o_i]_{i in [1,n]}, types [i]_{i in [1,n]}
