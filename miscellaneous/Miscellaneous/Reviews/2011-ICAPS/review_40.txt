*** REVIEW:

The paper studies the complexity of different fragments of the problem
of scheduling coupled-tasks in presence of compatibility constraints
given as a compatibility graph. It builds on previous work of Orman &
Potts and shows that the addition of compatibility constraints changes
the magnitude of complexity of some problems (from polynomial to
NP-complete) whereas some problems stay polynomial. An approximation
algorithm is also provided for one of the NP-complete fragments.

I think the topic of the paper is relevant to ICAPS. Even if
complexity studies of pure deterministic scheduling problems (without
any planning or uncertainty aspect) are not very common at ICAPS, they
bring interesting insights into specific problems that can be of
interest for the ICAPS community. In this paper for instance, some
proofs of polynomiality (Lemma 2, Problem Pi'_3) make interesting
links with some polynomial graph problems that may be useful in other
contexts. 

The paper is well organised, quite easy to read and technically
correct.

The paper starts with a motivating example of scheduling data
acquisition in a context where compatibility constraints between tasks
are due to frequencies and interferences: two tasks are incompatible
and cannot overlap if they work with the same frequency. I was very
surprised to see that this particular type of compatibility
constraint, which leads to a compatibility graph with a very specific
topology, is not exploited in the study. The study is based on a
general graph G_c whereas, in the case of compatibility due to
frequency, the graph G_c belongs to a subclass of interval graphs. For
these graphs, most of the classical problems that are NP-complete on
general graphs become polynomial (and even linear) like max-clique,
weighted independent sets, dominating sets, etc. My first intuition,
but I may be wrong, is that the introduction of compatibility graphs
that are interval graphs does not fundamentally change the complexity
of the original problem without compatibility constraints. It would be
very useful to integrate that in the study otherwise, the complexity
results, as they are now, seem too over-generalized and be a bit far
from the motivating problem.

Some more detailed comments:

p1, col1: "submarine several topological surveys" => "several
submarine topological surveys" ?

p2, fig2: shouldn't it be an inclusion link between ai=bi=p,Li=L
(\Pi_1) and ai=a,Li=L,bi=b (\Pi_2) ?

p2, col1: missing parenthesis in "We note \sigma{A_i}"

p3, col1: in the proof of Lemma 1, I do no understand the last part of
the sentence ", while any sub-task of A_i can fit in the idle time of
task A_j". How can it be as the idle time L is lower than p ?

p4, col1: in "Study of problem \Pi'_3: "For this section we will use
the following notation: ...". I do not see which notations are
introduced here ...

p5, col1: in "Study of problem \Pi'_4: the symmetry between \Pi'_3 and
\Pi'_4 is quite evident in fact. I think this section could be made
shorter if needed.

p6, col1: "L>=2np". I guess it is a typo and it should read "L>=2p".

p6, col2: "Moreover, by considering ...". At first when reading this
paragraph, I had the feeling that it describes the computation of an
upper bound. This lower bound would deserve a little more space I
think to explain that (1) isolated vertexes indeed form an independent
set and that (2) the lower bound is obtained by adding two lower
bounds from two distinct sub-problems (2a) independent set of isolated
vertexes and (2b) the vertexes of the maximal matching assuming no
idle time.

p6-7: Lemma5. I'm not sure to get the proof in detail. The lemma
speaks of maximal cliques whereas ("the first idea consists in
researching maximal cliques ..."), in the proof, the size of these
cliques seems to be limited to L/p. The proof says that each maximal
clique corresponds to a block but what if the clique is larger than
L/p ? In fact, the lemma seems to be used in Theorem 5 only for a
partition into K cliques of size 2 so for simplification, I would
rather remove Lemma 5 and present in the proof of theorem 5 the
construction of a valid schedule from the maximum matching M.

p7, col2: at the very top of the column, it is not clear why the
maximal ratio is obtained for m=(Ln)/(2(p+L)).

*** REMARKS FOR THE PROGRAMME COMMITTEE:
---  If you wish to add any remarks for PC members, please write
---  them below. These remarks will only be used during the PC
---  meeting. They will not be sent to the authors. This field is
---  optional.

The complexity study is interesting but I was quite disappointed that
they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem, namely,
the fact that for the type of application they deal with the
compatibility graph is not a general graph. They somehow over
generalize the problem and this leads to weaker results (NP-complete
fragments, loose approximation algorithm).
