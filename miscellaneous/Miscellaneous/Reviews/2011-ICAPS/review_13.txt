*** REVIEW FORM ID: 549084::252889
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 13
*** TITLE: Scheduling an Aircraft Repair Shop
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
--- CATEGORY: full technical paper
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie

*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The paper defines an aircraft repair scheduling problem and proposes
and compares several approaches to solve it. The problem mainly
involves two components: the individual scheduling of aircraft repair
activities in the repair shop (a typical detailed scheduling problem)
and the allocation of a certain number of planes to a set of
predefined missions (waves). This two stage problem, combined with
some uncertainties due to the fact aircrafts may or may not pass some
pre- and post-flight checks and thus won't be available for later
missions makes the overall problem quite challenging.

The authors compare several approaches the most efficient of which
use Benders decomposition methods which really makes sense here due
to the "natural" decomposition of the problem. There is also a
comparison with a pure MIP approach. Did you also consider a pure
CP approach?

In the section about experiments, it would be informative to see on
the figures how the approaches scale with problem size (essentially,
the number of aircrafts). Is the selected range for the number of
aircrafts ([10,30]) representative of the real problems? If real
problems are larger one may need to sacrifice optimality proofs and
focus on providing good quality solutions. In this context, it would
be useful in the experiments to also study the objective value
of the best solutions found by the different approaches (not
necessarily proved to be optimal).

Some more detailed remarks:

p2, col2: In the problem definition, item about W: I do not understand
the reason for this "big value B". Could you elaborate?

p3, col1: the notion of a due-date associated with each aircraft is
not clear when it is first introduced in the MIP section. One after
understands that each aircraft j needs to be associated a deadline
d_i that is equal to the starting time of one of the waves st_w and
this will permit to have this aircraft available for all waves
starting after d_i. This should be made clearer I think.

p3, col2: another thing that seems to be implicit and should be
clearly stated is that the waves seems to be ordered by ascending
start times which justifies the use of index (w-1) in constraints (4).

p4, col2: in the Benders-MIP-T approaches, the "T" for "tighter
relaxation" is the tighter relaxation described on the top of the
column, right?
