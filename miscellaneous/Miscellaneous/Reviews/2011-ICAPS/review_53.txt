The paper describes a complete search algorithm for solving the
job-shop problem with operators. The approach is compared with the
results obtained by Agnetis et al. 2010 who worked on the same
problem.

The paper is well organized and quite clear but sometimes the
notations, which are in general one-letter notations (A,E,I,Q,etc.),
are not easy to remember. Maybe the readability could be improved by
providing more explicit notations (using more than one letter) or just
by given a short summary of all notations in the end of the paper.

The approach is interesting, particularly the branching scheme that
exploits the specificities of the problem to reduce the branching
factor (selection of the subset B). Except for that, most of the
ingredients of the approach are not really new and are commonly used
in constrained-based scheduling:
- preemptive one-machine relaxation in the heuristic
- precedence energy reasoning for computing the operations head, see
  equations (1) and (2)
- global energy reasoning in the heuristic

I'm surprised there are no reference to the constrained-based
scheduling literature which provides more powerful inference
techniques than the ones used in the paper (time-tabling, edge-finding
algorithms [1], precedence energy [2]). For instance, one part of the
heuristic function consists in computing a lower bound on the makespan
reasoning on the set of all requirements of non-scheduled operations
on the operators. This seems to be very similar to an edge-finder
algorithm but the edge-finder would consider all the subsets of
non-scheduled operations which could lead to a better
bound. Furthermore, constraint propagation would allow obtaining
better bounds for head and tails.

It would also be interesting to understand why the operator resources
are considered as a set of p disjunctive resources instead of a single
non-renewable resource of capacity p. Efficient algorithms are
available for handling this type of resources and that would permit a
more compact representation of the problem and naturally eliminate
symmetries. The use of disjunctive resources indeed introduces some
symmetries as in an optimal solution, the operators can be exchanged
without impacting the optimality. By the way, breaking these
symmetries could be a way to improve the current approach.

Concerning the experimental study, it would be useful to somehow give
the detailed results (makespan value) for each instance to make future
comparisons with this approach easier. For curiosity, I tried a very
naive model of the problem with IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio
using the CP Optimizer algorithm with a time-limit of 300s (the tool
can be downloaded free of charge for research activities). This tool
makes it possible to model operators as a nonrenewable resource and
implements some powerful constraint propagation. From the other hand,
as it is very generic, the automatic search does not fully exploit the
specificities of the problem, in particular for optimality
proofs. Still, the results are interesting as it seems to be very
competitive with the proposed approach except for the 10 jobs / 10
machines problems when the number of operators is large and the
problem is getting closer to a classical job-shop. The model in C++ is
attached. I think it shows the interest of considering this problem in
the context of constraint-based scheduling.

Some more detailed comments and typos:

p2, col1: it's said that "An operator arc between u and v is fixed
when (u,v), (v,u) or none of them is selected, and fixing the arc
(O^start_i,u) means discarding (O^start_i,v) for any operation v other
than u. Analogously for (u,O^end_i)". I don't think this is enough to
ensure the satisfaction of the operator constraints. One should say
that there must exist a path from each O^start_i to the corresponding
O^end_i that only goes through fixed operator arcs.

p3, col1: some reference is missing after the one to (Mattfeld
1995). There are several occurrences of this problem in the paper.

p3, col1: in equation (3) you use $v$ to denote the elements of $A$
and in the rest of the section, you use $u$. It would be better to use
the same notation.

p5, col2: in item 2, shouldn't we read av(s_1) <= av(s_2) instead of >= ?

p6, col2: you mention the "pruning rules to reduce the search space"
is it the same as the dominance rules of the previous question or is
it a superset of these rules?
