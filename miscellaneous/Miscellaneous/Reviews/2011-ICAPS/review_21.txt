The paper is about a genetic algorithm approach for solving a
semiconductor manufacturing scheduling problem. 

The problem is relevant to the conference unfortunately, at reading
the paper, it is very difficult to get an idea of the actual
contribution. This is mostly because:

1- The organization of the paper is quite confusing. 

- The first part of the introduction lists a set of techniques used in
  EA's literature and it is difficult to see what is the contribution of
  the present paper, especially as far as the notion of "specie" is
  concerned.

- The second part of the introduction "Scheduling Problems in
  Semiconductor Manufacturing" mixes a description of the tools and
  resources used in semiconductor manufacturing with the set of
  decisions to be taken and then, the following section "Cluster Tools"
  is back to a description of the tools/resource used.

- The alpha|beta|gamma classification makes sense only if the
  different terms are well known in the literature (like C_max) or
  formally defined in the paper. Here, this is not the case for R and
  lrc (see below) so this classifications does not really make sense.

2- The problem is not formally defined. As a consequence, there are
many possible interpretations. For instance:

- Batch tools: are there constraints on the number and compatibility
  of jobs in a batch ? Which ones ? This is essential to understand the
  difficulty of grouping jobs into batches.

- Cluster tools:
 * the notion of job recipe is not defined. Is there an alternative
   set of possible recipes for a job? What kind of information is
   attached to a recipe?
 * it is not clear how the slow down is taken into account as the
   recipe mix is changing with time. Is the slowdown related with
   the recipe mix at the moment a job enters the tool?

- Problem complexity: it is mentioned several times in the paper that
  finding a feasible solution (not an optimal one) is a difficult
  problem. Is this problem NP-complete? If yes why? (I do not see
  anything in the problem description that would prevent delaying 
  the jobs as one wants)

3- The approach is described in very general and vague terms. 

- It is difficult to see how exactly a schedule is built from the
  DNA. Figures 4 and 5 could help but it does not say what type of
  machines/tools are depicted. It seems to be "simple tools" that
  perform one job at a time but then nothing is said about the decoding
  of DNA for batch and cluster tools. Furthermore, A_0, A_1, B_2,
  ... are called "jobs" on the figure but the text is focused on the
  notion of "recipe" (which is not really defined, see above). This is
  very confusing.

4- Experimental results

- The comparison against a purely random approach is not really
  informative, furthermore, it is not explained how random schedules are
  generated. It is mentioned earlier in the paper that "Other algorithms
  we implemented include simulated annealing, hill climbing, ant colony
  optimization, particle swarm optimization, and many others." Why
  didn't you compare against these algorithms ?

- I have the feeling that, in the approach, the n different species do
  not interact at all (no mating, no influence of the other species
  population size, ...). If it is really so, what is the difference with
  running n independent GAs based on different DNA representations ?

Some typos:
p3,col1: "the importance off ..."
p3, col2: "a combination of more then one ..."
