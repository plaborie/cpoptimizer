The article deals with a very relevant and challenging routing problem in the context of the delivery of frozen food.

The problem is very well introduced and described in the paper with, to the best of my knowledge, a good review of the literature on the topic.

The article is well organized, clearly written and easy to read. 

I think the model presented in section 4 should be clarified with respect to the notion of "waiting time". It seems that in the proposed model, waiting time (at a given node) is not allowed: as formulated in equation 13b, the departure time at a node 'i' is equal to the arrival time plus the duration of the unloading operations. I suppose this is justified by the fact that, in practice, the travel times and the fuel consumption satisfy some "first in / first out (FIFO)" property so that delaying the departure from a node can only increase the total fuel consumption. Though it is very reasonable that this property hold in the "real problem", the current model introduces some discretization in time slots (variables slot[i,k]) that - it seems - violate this FIFO property: suppose the end time of the unloading activity at a node finishes 1s earlier than the end of a time slot and that in the next time slot - so only 1s later - the temperature becomes cooler or the vehicle speed increases because of some traffic decongestion, then it worth waiting 1s for the next slot but this does not seem to be allowed in the model. I think this should be discussed in section 4. Note that using continuous piecewise linear functions instead of step functions for temperatures and speeds would certainly be closer to the reality and avoid these "non-FIFO" issues.

On a similar line, in the current model, the speed is completely determined by the starting time. But we can imagine that is some cases it can be better for the vehicle to slow down in order to consume less fuel. This does not seem to be allowed in the current model.

It seems that the CP formulation could be improved by using the so-called "element constraints" instead of boolean variables for the slot[i,k] variables. If you use integer variables slot[i] for representing the slot of delivery i (if slots are all of the same duration, it can be as simple as slot[i] == t_arrival[i] div SLOT_DURATION where div is the integer division), then instead of some sums over k in equations 8b and 8c (which result in very weak inference in CP engines), you can use an element constraint A[slot[i]] where A is an array of values, A[k] denoting the value of the contribution to the expression when slot[i]=k. The same comment holds for the speeds in equations 11 and 12b. This would certainly increase the inferences in the CP engine and improve performance.

The points mentioned above can be considered as minor even if I think they should be addressed in order to clarify the paper. The main issue is that, given the size of the problems considered in the experimental section (up to 8 nodes), the interest of using CP for solving the problem is not justified. If I understand well, the only actual decision variables of the model are the x[i] variables. Once they are fixed, the route is known and, given that waiting time is not allowed and speeds are completely determined by starting time (see comments above), then everything (including the cost) is fixed. So if the problem is only at most 8 nodes large, a very naive exhaustive approach could evaluate each of the 8!=40320 in (I guess) a fraction of a second, much faster than the 12 minutes required by the CP model. So I think that a requirement for using CP (or any other solving technology) would be to show that the CP model can scale better than a naive brute force approach.

As a conclusion, I think that after clarifying the problem formulation (why are waiting times or vehicle slowdowns not allowed?), the article should perform a comparison of the proposed CP approach against a brute-force technique, or show that the proposed CP model can scale to problem sizes that are out of reach of a brute-force technique.
