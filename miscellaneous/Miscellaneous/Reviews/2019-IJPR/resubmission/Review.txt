The manuscrit has been improved since last submission. In particular, the CP formulation of the problem and the performance study, which is now more acceptable. So I recommend acceptance. Here are a few suggestions to improve the article before it is published (references are page/lines of the proof):

- on p15, line 40 (equation 1): I think at this point you should say that T_o and T_i respectively denote the outdoor and indoor temperatures

- on p16, in paragraph starting at line 19: you describe t_stop, but then explain how a quantity t_drop is computed. What is the relation between t_stop and t_drop? Are they the same variable?

- on p18, line 53 (equation 6): because of the form of the objective function as a sum over the nodes i, I think you should say that the variables fuelX[i] account for both the incremental use of fuel at node i together with the travel from i to the next node in the route.

- on p19, in equations 8c and 8d, the definition of the content of the array 'Days' is unclear. It seems it is some sort of 0/1 value that says whether or not the current month is j ... In fact I do not see the interest of a sum over all the months j here. I suppose that for a particular instance of the problem, the current month j is known so maybe you can just take into account the current month in the definition of slotT[i] in equation 7 to return the suitable index for accessing the arrays To, COP, etc... 

- on p28, about future work: the current study focuses indeed on the exact resolution of the problem with CP and, for larger (maybe more realistic) problems, it may indeed be the case that one should go with more heuristic approaches (like local search). But there exists CP systems used in industrial problems (like CP Optimizer [1]) that are much less relying on constraint propagation and implement some sophisticated automatic search that exploits the objective function, even when the objective functions are complex. So maybe it would also be interesting to study the possible use of this type of CP engine for more complex/larger versions of the problem (without the need to implement problem-specific algorithms like dedicated local search).
