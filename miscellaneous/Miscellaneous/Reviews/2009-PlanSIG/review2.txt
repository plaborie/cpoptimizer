The paper tackles a very relevant topic, the one of planning and
scheduling for human/computer interactions. Unfortunately, the paper is
very hard to understand because it manipulate concepts that are not
clearly defined in the context of the work (UI event, actions,
etc.). More formalization and more examples would really help.

The role of the CSP in an iteration process that is used for
discovering new constraints is quite clear but the introduction of
planning and scheduling is not. 

Planning.

The definition of the planning problem seems quite far from the
classical models: usually, a goal is a subset of states whereas here,
it seems to represent a sequence of states.

As far as I understand, the actions in the plan are knowledge
acquisition actions, so their effect is highly non-deterministic. What
kind of planning algorithm is used for computing a plan ? (The
description of the algorithm on Figure 6 is really too high level to
have a real understanding).

Scheduling.

I do not see the interest of using constraint-based scheduling
here. Constraint-based scheduling deals with durative actions and
scarce resources. In the context of the application, do actions really
have a duration? What does this duration represent? What are the
resources in this context? 

As a conclusion, I think this paper describes a work that is at a
very early stage. This work really seems interesting but it would
deserve more maturation to be presented in a paper (more details,
more formalization and/or more examples).

More detailed comments: 

p1, col1: "Our ongoing matchmaker project": it could be interesting to
say a bit more about this project.

p1, col2: the second item introduces the notion of 'action', it would
be good to give a hint about what an action is.

p2, col1: the HCI acronym is introduced but only decoded in the next
column

p2, col2: constant-based approach

p2, col2: nothing is said about the role of the planner and scheduler
in the "System architecture" section.

p2, col2: the notion of UI event is introduced but not explained. It
would be good to give an example. 

p3, col1, Figure 2: Interation

p3, col2, Figure 3: operartion

p3, col2, Figure 3: it would be good to add some labels on the arcs
(like "isA", etc.)

p3, col2, Figure 4: some terms do not seem consistent with the
description in the text (Supports <=> Enables?).

p4, col2: the definition of a plan as a tuple <A,I,G> rather looks
like the definition of a planning problem, not a plan.

p5, col2: CSB <=> CBS, schedular
