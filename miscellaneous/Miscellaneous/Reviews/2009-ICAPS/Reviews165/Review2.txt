This paper presents experimental results corresponding to the implementation of a method called IFS - that comes from the AI research community - run on one of the most generic - and difficult - scheduling problem called RCPSP-max.
The authors briefly present the original global algorithm of this specific method and then focus mainly on its parametrization on "small" benchmark instances, in order to have interesting results on very large-sized ones. This latter contribution is to my mind sufficient for this submission to be published as a short paper in the proceedings of ICAPS'09.
Nevertheless, the structure of the article should be slightly reconsidered. Instead of insisting on the global algorithm (a specific paragraph AND the algorithm in Figure 2), the two strategies of the relaxation procedures could be at least more detailed. This would help the appropriation of the methodology and the understanding of specific comments in the analysis of the experiments at the end of the paper.
Similarly, I would recommend not to put very precisely into words the data presented in Tables 1 and 2, but to focus on an acute analysis of these data.
Furthermore, the progression from an analysis of parameters on small instances to the application of the best parameters on large-sized instances should be argued - especially for parameter $n_r$.
The literature references are relevant and sufficient.

Please find below some minor remarks. My final advice would be this article to be read by a native english speaker, in order to remove all bad english constructions, spelling mistakes or unclear formulations.

Abstract: 
	l9 "solving" vs "flattening"?
Intro: 
	c1 l-2 "to effectively solve"
	c2 l5 "extension"
	c2 sentence "This circumstance ... NP-hard." unclear
Reference Problem and its Representation:
	l8 "temporal separation constraints"?
	please mention the non preemption of the activities, the renewability of the resources, and define the notions of time- and resource-feasibility
	In the note, $T_{ij}$ could be replaced by $d_i$?
	p2 l8 "solve" unclear
Experimental Analysis:
	general: "efficiency" more appropriate than "efficacy"
	p3c1 please define MCJSSP	
	p3c1 symbol $\approx$ not appropriate in a sentence
	p3c1 sentence "The previous ... procedure." unclear 
Conclusion and Future Work:
	c2 "a hard", "a higher"
	l-1 "from"
	

Relevance -  Is the work relevant to the call for papers?
	Relevant according to the point "Analytic and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms for solving them" in the CfP
Significance - To what extent are the ideas and contributions of the paper novel and important to planning and scheduling theory or practice?
	Closure of several large-sized instances of the literature
Technical quality - Is the work technically sound? Are the analyses, algorithms, theorems and proofs correct? Are the paper's claims argued/supported convincingly? Is the empirical evaluation convincing?
	The empirical analysis is convincing.
Quality of presentation - Is the paper clearly written? Is it well-organized? Is the motivation for the research or the innovation of the application well explained?
	Could be reorganized as mentioned above.
Suitability to AIJ - Should an extended version of this paper be solicited for submission to Artificial Intelligence Journal?
	No sufficient theoretical contribution, no tuning of the existing method
