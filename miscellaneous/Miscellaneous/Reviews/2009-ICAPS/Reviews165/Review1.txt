*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

Relevance -  Is the work relevant to the call for papers?

Yes - highly relevant

Significance - To what extent are the ideas and contributions of the  
paper novel and important to planning and scheduling theory or practice?

The paper presents results of an experimental study of an existing
algorithm, Iterative Flattening Search (IFS) , on the Resource
Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP) with maximal time
lags(RCPSP/max). A number of previous papers have discussed the IFS
algorithm on the pure RCPSP (without maximum time lags). Since the
algorithm has been modified very little (if at all), the paper
presents an incremental contribution.  It is interesting to see that
IFS can work well on problems where finding even a feasible solution
is not always trivial.

The experimental results look interesting and significant. Some of the
PSPLIB problems used in the study can be quite difficult to solve
using pure CP methods.

Technical quality - Is the work technically sound? Are the analyses,  
algorithms, theorems and proofs correct? Are the paper's claims argued/ 
supported convincingly? Is the empirical evaluation convincing?

Some details are missing from the paper, and there is not sufficient
information given to reproduce the exact IFS algorithm that is
used. 

It is stated that in the flattening phase of IFS precedence
constraints are posted between activities in a minimal conflict
set. However there is no reference to or description of how these
constraints are identified (there are at least 2 ways of doing this in
the research literature). It is also stated that resource constraint
propagation is used in the flattening phase. I would like to know
which resource constraint filtering algorithms are being used.

With maximal lags I believe the IFS algorithm can reach states in the
search which are infeasible i.e. no more precedence constraints can be
posted to resolve a minimal critical set.  It is not clear what the
IFS algorithm does in this case - is the search restarted from the
beginning or is the usual IFS relaxation step applied?

It is not stated how the initial solution is generated. Since the
authors state that the feasibility version of the RCPSP/max problem is
is NP-hard (shouldn't this be NP-complete), it would be good to know
this.

Quality of presentation - Is the paper clearly written? Is it well-
organized? Is the motivation for the research or the innovation of the
application well explained?

The paper is quite clearly written, although missing some details.
Given that this is a short paper submission this may be OK, but I
would prefer to see more detail on the algorithmic approach used.

There are some minor typos.

Suitability to AIJ - Should an extended version of this paper be  
solicited for submission to Artificial Intelligence Journal?

No.
