---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

Relevance -  Is the work relevant to the call for papers?

The paper presents a very interesting application for NASA's Deep
Space Network scheduling. As a description of a scheduling
application, this work is relevant to the call for papers. But because
the paper covers all the aspects of the application (modeling language
based on requests, description of the complex objective function,
scheduling algorithms, application architecture, user interface) it is
really missing important technical details on the underlying automated
planning and scheduling technologies that would make it interesting
for the ICAPS general track. For instance, the request language and
the link between requests and the generated activities should be more
detailed and formalized. Same thing for the scheduling algorithms (the
paper only mentions that they are based on some relaxations and repair
methods). There probably is material for a couple of more focused
technical papers that would better fit the ICAPS general track. In the
current format, I encourage the authors to submit the paper to the
ICAPS workshop on "Scheduling and Planning Applications woRKshop"
(SPARK) that would be more adequate for the current version of the
paper.

Significance - To what extent are the ideas and contributions of the  
paper novel and important to planning and scheduling theory or practice?

The main contribution of the paper, besides the presentation of the
application itself is the shift from activity-oriented scheduling to a
request-based approach. This shift is significant and can be
considered as a move from pure scheduling to a mix of planning and
scheduling as the activities need to be generated from the
requests. Unfortunately, there is too few technical details and
formalization in the paper to really understand how activities are
generated.


Technical quality - Is the work technically sound? Are the analyses,  
algorithms, theorems and proofs correct? Are the paper's claims argued/ 
supported convincingly? Is the empirical evaluation convincing?

There is not enough technical details in the paper to assess the
technical soundness of the approach. Nevertheless, the switch from
activity-oriented to a request-driven approach is well motivated.

Quality of presentation - Is the paper clearly written? Is it well- 
organized? Is the motivation for the research or the innovation of the  
application well explained?

The paper is clearly written and the work is well motivated. The
description of the algorithms is so high-level that I think the 3
algorithms on page 5 do not bring additional information; they could
be omitted and that would leave some space for additional details.

Suitability to AIJ - Should an extended version of this paper be  
solicited for submission to Artificial Intelligence Journal?

I don't think, in the current state of the work this paper can be
extended to an AIJ submission. More work should probably be necessary
to formalize the request language and the description of the
scheduling algorithms.
