Paper title: 
Evaluating the Impact of AND/OR Search on 0-1 Integer Linear Programming

Authors: Radu Marinescu, Rina Dechter


The article builds on previous work of the authors on AND/OR search
spaces. The present article applies and extends this previous work to
0-1 ILP and describes techniques such as dynamic variables ordering
and caching to speed-up the search.

This work is significant for 0-1 ILP and more generally for ILP and
MIP. The experimental results although limited to 3 types of problems
are encouraging.

I think the paper could be improved on two aspects:

1. Highlighting the original contribution of the present paper with
respect to previous work of the authors on AND/OR search spaces. I
have noticed that the authors payed attention to thoroughly refer to
previous work of their own but it is not always clear on each
particular topic (e.g. caching or dynamic variable ordering) what was
done previously and how the present approach exploits the
particularity of 0-1 ILP compared to more general constraint
optimization problems.

2. Making it more self-contained. In general, the paper is well
written but some particular points should be more detailed in order to
make the article more self-contained. For instance:

 - the notion of induced graph should be better explained, maybe with
 a figure. I find the following sentence confusing: "For each node all
 its earlier neighbors are connected, including neighbors connected by
 previously added edges".

 - in the definition of the notion of pseudo-tree, it is not clear
 whether E' has to be a subset of E (in the example on Figure 2 it is
 the case but I guess it does not have to)

 - the notions of context and cache should be more detailed in the
 paper, even if it has already been described in previous work.

In the future work, I was surprised that the generalization of the
presented approach to general ILP and to MIP was not mentioned. I have
the feeling that the approach can easily be generalized to MIP and
that would dramatically improve the scope of the approach. 

Some more detailed comments:

p4: "One of the most important constraint optimization problems ...":
this sentence describes general ILP and then, just under, the
definition is not the one of general ILP as one could expect but the
one of the more restricted 0-1 ILP.

p34: Typo: "Our depth-first AND Branch-and-Bound" => AND/OR.
