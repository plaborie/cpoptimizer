1) SUMMARY (please provide brief answers)

- What is/are the main contribution(s) of the paper?

This paper presents the principles of CoCoP a constructive constraint
programming system and describe leanCoP, a theorem prover that is used
as a first implementation of CoCoP.

4) SUGGESTED/REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS;

The work described in this paper really seems to be in a very early
stage which surely explains why no real evidence of the interest of
using a planner based on theorem proving is given. Furthermore,
although the title of the paper mentions the application of the
approach to Presentation Planning, this problem is not described at
all and it really makes it hard to understand the choice of the
proposed techniques to solve this planning problem. I think the
Presentation Planning problem should be described or - at least - the
title should be changed.

The second part of the paper starting with section "The Mechanics of
CoCoP" is hard to follow. The link with leanCoP and with constructive
CP is not trivial. It is difficult to understand how CoCoP avoids the
limitations related with sitation calculus.

However, not being an expert in the field I cannot properly assess the
contibution of the paper.

Typos:

p4, paragraph starting with "Besided the similarities ...": this
ability will probably "be" used

Comments for the Program Committee only (use this slot only if
necessary):

I really hesitate between recommending this paper as a short paper or
rejecting it. My decision to accept is due to my low confidence in the
subject area but I see no problem with rejecting this paper.
