Title: Decision Making for Improving Maritime Traffic Safety Using Constraint Programming

Review
Relevance [1-10] 7
Is the paper fully within the scope of the conference? Will the questions and results of the paper be of interest to researchers in the field?

Significance [1-10] 7
Is this a significant advance in the state of the art? Is this a paper that people are likely to read and cite? Does the paper address an important problem? Does it open new research directions? Is it a paper that is likely to have a lasting impact?

Originality [1-10] 7
Reviewers should recognise and reward papers that propose genuinely new ideas. As a reviewer you should try to assess whether the ideas are truly new. Novel combinations, adaptations or extensions of existing ideas are also valuable.

Technical Quality [1-10] 7
Are the results technically sound? Are there obvious flaws in the conceptual approach? Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Are the experiments well thought out and convincing? Will it be possible for other researchers to replicate these results? Is the evaluation appropriate? Did the authors clearly assess both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach?

Clarity and quality of writing [1-10] 7
Is the paper clearly written? Is there a good use of examples and figures? Is it well organized? Are there problems with style and grammar? Are there issues with typos, formatting, references, etc.? It may be better to advise the authors to revise a paper and submit to a later conference, than to accept and publish a poorly-written version. However, if the paper is likely to be accepted, please make suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper, and provide details of typos.

Scholarship [1-10] 7
Does the paper situate the work with respect to the state of the art? Are relevant papers cited, discussed, and compared to the presented work?

Overall Score [1-10] 7
10- This is best-paper material. 
9- An excellent paper, a very strong accept. 
8-A very good paper, a strong accept 
7-A good paper, accept. 
6-A good paper overall. I vote for acceptance, although would not be upset if it were rejected because of the low acceptance rate. 
5-Decent paper, but may be below the IJCAI threshold. I tend to vote for rejecting it, although would not be upset if it were accepted. 
4-I vote for rejecting it, but could be persuaded otherwise. 
3-A weak paper, just not good enough. 
2-A clear rejection. I vote and argue for rejection. Clearly below the standards of the conference. 
1-A very strong rejection. I will actively fight for rejection.

The paper describes a combinatorial optimization problem for the short term rescheduling of the maritime traffic in dense areas. The problem can be thought of as an extension of the RCPSP. It is solved using Constraint Programming.

The problem is quite original, even if a similar problem (but for the global scheduling of the traffic, and using other techniques) was recently treated at AAAI-2018. The paper is clearly written (though clarity could sometimes be improved, see below) and the experimental study is convincing (even if additional details could be provided, see below).

Overall, I think it is an interesting paper that fits well the special track on "AI for improving human well being".

Detailed comments:

The description and formulation of the problem could be improved in some places. In particular:

* Fig. 2: it seems that on the figure, described activities are A_11, A_12, whereas in the description it is A_i1, A_i2, ...

* p2, col1, section 2.2: "As mentioned earlier, we assume that the set of activities (and the time to finish such activities) ... is predicted ahead of time". Ok, but at first reading one may think that this means that the duration of the activities A_ij is fixed in the problem, which is of course clearly not the case.

* p2, col2: "We declare these activity interval variables with a range (tmin, tmax)". I would precise: with a range *for the size* in [tmin,tmax]. 

* on Tables 1 and 2, though the model is not very complex, it is typeset in a way that makes it artificially hard to follow:
  * it is very difficult to make the difference between the variables (act_ij, time_act_ij, speed_act_ij, Y_i) and the constants of the problem (tmin, tmax, speed^avg_act_ij, distance_act_ij...). I would use some clear conventions like constants start with upper case, variable with lower case.
  * some constraints like (17) or (18) seem to be redundant with the definition of the duration range tmin, tmax in Table 1, do you really need these constraints in table 2?
  * if consumption^k_ij is always 1, then maybe you can just use 1 in the model
  * I would group (9), (15) and maybe (16) in a single constraint: \sum_i { | LE_i - histCT_i | >= \gamma } <= \theta  (no need for variable Y_i)
  * I would rather write constraint (14) as: cumResource_k <= capacity_k + cost_k   (cost_k being the additional capacity)

* p5, col1: "Constraint (10) specifies that the first activity of a vessel can begin exactly at its release time." I would say "must" begin ...

* p5, col1: typo "Preceedence"

In the experimental section, I think you should say something about the size of the problems in your dataset:
* Typical number of vessel scheduled
* Typical number of activities for each vessel

Considering the citations:

* I'm not sure you need to cite the reference [IBM,2019] for the pulse function. Maybe after "We now describe built-in constructs provided by CP Optimizer
that we use in our model", you can cite either the Constraint journal paper, or a more general pointer to the documentation like: http://ibm.biz/CPO_Documentation

* In the references, many upper-cases are missing, particularly in the paper titles: "straits of Malacca", "IBM ILOG CP Optimizer", "AIS-based vessel trajectory",...

Metareview

Summary of the strong and weak points of the paper. This text should justify your recommendation to the Area Chair about acceptance or rejection of the paper but do not mention anything about acceptance or rejection in the metareview as this text will be read by authors and the final decision on acceptance and rejection will be taken later in the process. Explain the impact of the rebuttal and the discussions and preserve the anonymity of the process.

Recommendation
Suggest Accept, Borderline or Reject to the Area Chair. 
You may select Undecided if the discussion is still going on, and Special Case if this is a special case that needs attention of the area chair, such as an inconclusive discussion.
