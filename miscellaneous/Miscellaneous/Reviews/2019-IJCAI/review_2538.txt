The article is on a single machine scheduling problem with both production jobs and maintenance activities where the objective is to minimize a weighted sum of earliness and tardiness costs. An additional ingredient of the problem is that maintenance activities use human operators so the problem also includes the allocation of operators to maintenance activities (operators have different availability periods and can perform the maintenance activities with different speed depending on their competence).

The proposed approach is a Guided Local Search that exploits the different features of the problem (tardiness cost on jobs, earliness and tardiness cost on maintenance activities).

Although the problem is quite simple, its description in section 2 is not always clear (see "Imprecisions in problem definition" below).

One of the main problems with the paper is that it introduces a fairly complex method but the interest of the different ingredients of the approach are not evaluated in the experimental section. Also, the approach is not compared against other techniques which is something that would have been easy to do (see "Comparison with other approaches" below). The comparison with the CPLEX MIP on the small instances is not really impressing (with distance to optimal solutions up to 11% on small problems) and most of the conclusions in the experimental section (comparison of the different strategies showing that the "efficiency" one is the best) are straightforward.

Also, there are many typos in the paper that would have been easily found with a spell checker.

Imprecisions in problem definition

The "ideal" position of maintenance intervals is described as: "a maintenance Mi must be completed within a time window TI_i = [Tmin_i; Tmax_i]". At this point it seems like you describe an absolute position of maintenance activity Mi but then, later on, one realize that you probably mean a relative position with respect to the previous maintenance activity. But it is never really clear. You say : "The ith time window depends on the completion time of the (i-1)th maintenance occurrenceMi-1". But the time-window is always [Tmin_i; Tmax_i], so how can it depend on the previous maintenance? I take it that, ideally, the end time of M_{i-1} minus the start time of M_i should be kept within [Tmin_i; Tmax_i]. This should be explained more formally.

The number of maintenance intervals N_occ is supposed to be given. Given that you do not know the position of the maintenance activities, it could be that in a solution, the last maintenance activity finishes way earlier than the last production job. I'm not sure this is very realistic. This is also related with the statement that "Since we seek scheduling over a production horizon, we do not perform a maintenance operation after the processing of the last job." I think that there should be some constraint that ensures that, in a certain way, the set of maintenance activities cover the set of production jobs.

The form of the earliness/tardiness functions both for production jobs and maintenance activities is not specified. Is it some linear cost, so for instance for the job tardiness something like: K*max(0,endOf(job)-DueDate) ? Please specify the formulas for E_i and T_i. One would for instance expect that the tardiness cost for maintenance is larger than for jobs and could maybe grow faster than a linear function ...

The assignment strategies (equity, efficiency and training) are mentioned in several part of the article (in problem description and in the end of the experimental section), but they are never really formalized and it is not clear how they are taken into account in the search. In any case, if these strategies are not taken into account in the objective function, it is evident that the strategy that use the most competent operators will be the one resulting on the best earliness/tardiness costs. I think it would have been interesting to consider variants of objective functions that take into account these strategies.

Comparison with other approaches

In the experimental section, you say that, on small problems, the approach is compared against a "CP" (I guess here, "CP" means "Constraint Programming") exact model using CPLEX described in [Touat et al., 2018]. The issue is that the model described in [Touat et al., 2018] is not a Constraint Programming model! It is a very classical Integer Linear Programming model which is known not to scale on large problems. I think you should compare your approach against a real CP model for your problem. I attach in the end of my review an example of formulation of the problem in CP (using the same OPL language used in [Touat et al., 2018]), using some random data. This formulation has no problem scaling to the largest instances of the study (700 jobs) so a comparison with the proposed GLS would be easy to do.

In general, it would be good to make the benchmark you generated publicly available to the community.



Other detailed comments

- p1, col2: "This paper deals with the single machine scheduling problem". Do you think the single machine assumption is realistic? Especially as, if there are several human resources dedicated to maintenance, one can hardly justify that all these resources will exclusively all work on the maintenance of this single machine.

- p1, col2: "moreoevre"

- p3, col2: the description of matrix Z is unclear. In particular m is the number of availability intervals: but it seems that the availability intervals depend on the operators so how can they be used as column of the matrix whose rows are the operators?

- p3, col1: "assosiate", "rresources" 

- p3, col1/2: "Our aim is to minimize the maintenance earliness/tardiness when the human resource availability intervals and the tolerance period do not overlap." Could you formalize this statement?

- p5, col1: "\alpha and \beta of equation 3 are set to 0.5". This is not really informative. The balance between the tardiness of production jobs and the earli/tardiness of maintenance activities depends on may other parameters (in particular, the choice of Tmin, Tmax, ...)
