Comments or advice to be passed back to the author(s) of the paper:

  First, it is extremely difficult to understand the paper because of
  the English. But from what I understand, it seems to me there is
  nothing really new in the paper:

  - modeling time-tabling problems in CP has been thoroughly studied
  (just search "timetabling constraint programming" on the web) and it
  is not clear what the proposed model brings compared with previous
  approaches (there is no comparison with previous work and no
  references)

  - the resolution approach mentioned in the paper seems to
  "rediscover" some classical concepts used for long in CP such as
  locality (only trigger propagation of constraints on variable whose
  domain changed) and incrementality of constraint propagation (use
  only the variation of the domain of variable to propagate
  incremental changes).


Any specific points that must be addressed before the paper is accepted:



Comments to Programme Committee (not to be passed to author(s) of the paper):

Please let me know if you want me to be a little softer in the
formulation of my comments. But there is really nothing in this paper.
