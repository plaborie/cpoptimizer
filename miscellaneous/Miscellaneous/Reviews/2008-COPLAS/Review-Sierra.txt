  The paper presents a new complete search for solving the job-shop
  scheduling problem with total flow time minimization. It is based on
  an A* search with a heuristic based on a lower bound described in
  Baptiste&al 2004.

  The approach could probably benefit from recent global constraints
  for propagating costs expressed as a sum, for instance the one
  described in:

  Kovacs, A. & Beck, J.C., "A Global Constraint for Total Weighted
  Completion Time", Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference
  on Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for
  Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CPAIOR'07), 2007.

  The comparison of the proposed approached based on A* with an
  approach based on meta-heuristics (local search) is surprising as
  their goal is quite different: A* will return an optimal solution
  whereas local search will iteratively improve a solution with no
  guarantee of optimality. A* will mostly be useful for small
  scheduling problems (in the experimental section, 9x9 seems to be
  the current limit) whereas LS is able to scale to much larger
  problems. In the experimental section, it would be clearer to
  replace the "Best sol." label by an "Optimal solution" as if I get
  it well those are the values of the optimal solutions found by
  A*. It is also a bit strange that the original instances ORB*
  (10x10) had to be truncated to a 9x9 size. Is it because the
  proposed A* was not able to satisfactorily solve them?

  In the description of the heuristic in section "New Heuristic for
  JSSP ...", it is not clear why the original problem which minimizes
  sum of completion times is relaxed into a problem which minimizes
  tardiness. The reason why some due-dates are introduced should be
  better explained. I suppose it is because the part of the constant
  cost until the due date is added to the cost of the relaxed solution
  as suggested by equation (4) but this equation shows up too late
  after the definition of the due date.

  A short paragraph describing why the heuristics can be computed in
  O(k log(k)) would be useful. 

  Any hint how a similar approach could be applied to the cutting
  stock problem? Both the constraints and the objective functions seem
  to be quite different from the JSSP with total flow time
  minimization.

Any specific points that must be addressed before the paper is accepted:

  p1: some English issues: 
  - col1: I'm not sure we can qualify the JSSP as a "paradigm"
  - col2: "confronting the JSSP by means of the A* algorithm" sounds
    strange to me

  p2, col2: "In the sequel we will use the following notations" is
  repeated twice.

  p3, col1: the acronym "OMS" is used without explanation (does it
  stand for One Machine Problem?).
