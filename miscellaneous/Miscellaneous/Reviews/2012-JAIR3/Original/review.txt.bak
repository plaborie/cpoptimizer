The article is an extension of the author's ICAPS-2011 paper on scheduling an aircraft repair shop. 
The following extensions are provided:
- A complexity proof of NP-completeness of the problem
- The dynamic version of the problem is introduced together with some approaches to handle it 
- The experimental section is extended to handle the dynamic version of the problem

The problem is challenging as it mixes allocation decisions (allocation of aircrafts to waves) 
and detailed scheduling (scheduling of repair activities in the shop) in a dynamic and uncertain 
environment.

The proposed logic-based Benders decomposition is very judicious as it exploits the limited correlation 
between the two types of decision variables in the problem. The Benders cuts are very interesting.

Could you give a little bit more precisions in the article on how the CP (sub)problems are modeled and solved. 
Both for the case the master sub-problem uses CP and for the scheduling problem. In particular, did you 
try some more recent CP solvers than Solver/Scheduler. I would expect that the advanced techniques used 
for instance in CP Optimizer can improve the performance of CP particularly for solving the master problem 
(the scheduling sub-problem seems to be easier).

The static version of the problem does not take into account the planes that participate into a flight 
and re-enter the repair shop because they did not pass a subsequent check. This explains why it is 
not really interesting to schedule too many waves in advance because for waves too far in the future, 
the repair shop will be in the reality much more loaded than what it is in the current static approach. 
Did you investigate or have some ideas about how the static approach could be extended to better handle 
this stochastic flow of new aircrafts entering the repair shop? Could that be handled by somehow leaving 
some availability slack on the repair resources?

I think there is a flaw in the proof of the NP-completeness of the problem: activities of processing 
time xi and resource requirement yi cannot be considered as a rectangle of size (xi,yi) in a 2D knapsack 
because each unit of capacity in [1,yi] does not have to be allocated to "contiguous" resources. 
It is well known that the "scheduling" problem is less constrained than the 2D packing. 
This being said, it is clear that the considered problem is NP-complete and a more direct problem 
related with it is the "Multiprocessor scheduling problem" (referenced SS8 in Garey-Johnson's 
Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness). I think this should be fixed in the published version.

In the section about experiments, is the selected problem size (number of aircrafts in [10,30]) 
representative of the real problems? If real problems are larger one may need to sacrifice 
optimality proofs and focus on providing good quality solutions. In this context, it would
be useful in the experiments to also study the objective value of the best solutions found 
by the different approaches on larger problems (not necessarily proved to be optimal).

Some more detailed remarks:

p3: in the description of the problem, when introducing set Ik it would help to precise that aircrafts 
of set Ik are the ones initially in the repair shop at t=0.

p5, section 3.1: in the reduced problem, the first wave is supposed to require all m aircrafts, right?

p6, table 1: it should be made clear that the ith due date assigned to job j is the start time of the 
ith wave (ordered by increasing due dates)

p11: I find policy P33 has a very limited interest. It should be clear that it is always inferior to P13 as 
it will re-inject in the repair shop the aircrafts failing in the first two waves only when the problem 
is rescheduled. It's only interest is to re-schedule less often.

p16: you mention that "if the number of available aircraft is more than the requirements,
the aircraft that fly are randomly selected from those that passed the pre-flight check". Does it really work 
like that in practice? Are all the available aircrafts systematically checked before each wave or only a 
subset of them until the desired number is reached?
