Dear Philippe, I'm writing in my role as JAIR associate editor to ask
you if you would undertake a review of the following paper. The review
would be due 10th Jan (about 7 weeks from now). 

Please let me know if you can do it. For you convience I attach a pdf
version so you can take a closer look. Here is the abstract:

thanks!

We study the factors that influence algorithm performance for an
oversubscribed scheduling application, allocating satellite
communication time slots on ground station antennas for the U.S. Air
Force.  We identify a set of fairly simple algorithms that perform
best relative to several constraint directed and heuristic
techniques. The algorithms in our set are: local search, a genetic
algorithm (GA) and Squeaky Wheel Optimization (SWO). These algorithms
are very different from each other in the way they traverse the search
space. We identify the problem characteristics that favor each of the
algorithms in the set, such as the redundancy of the search space, the
size of the search neighborhood and the proclivity of plateaus. We
find that the redundancy of the search space is the key factor in
local search performance. For the GA and SWO, the good performance is
the result of taking long leaps in the search space, by operating
multiple changes on the schedule at each step. Initializing the GA and
SWO with a greedy solution is also a factor in algorithm performance,
but is not as crucial as making long leaps.
