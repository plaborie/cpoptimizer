Philippe, great thanks. 

I think that I have already sent you the pdf. Let me know if I forgot
that. 

I append below some further info about the review:

 Fahiem 

=======================================================

Please send your review by electronic mail to

fbacchus@cs.toronto.edu   and
jair-ed@isi.edu

The format of the review is flexible, but please include the following

1. confidential comments to the editor in a separate section.

2. an overall evaluation of the paper
   "accept" or "reject"

  Please note that there are only two categories. JAIR does not accept
  papers subject to revisions. So the paper has to be essentially
  "ready to go" except perhaps for some minor modifications, to be
  rated "accept". 

  If the paper does not meet that standard it should be given a reject
  evaluation. However, in your comments the editor for "reject" papers
  you should indicate to me

  a) If the paper needs more substantial modifications but still has
     considerable merit. In this case I might encourage the authors
     to resubmit the paper after modifications.

  b) If you feel that even with the modifications you would like to
     see the end result would still be below the quality threshold
     expected of JAIR.. In this case I will not encourage
     resumission. 

3. comments to the authors. These comments should

  - justify your overall evaluation (note that you do not need to
    reveal your overall evaluation to the authors, but your comments
    should be consistent with that evaluation)

  - if you can, provide the authors with some helpful suggestions
    about how the work and manuscript can be improved. It is useful to
    bear in mind the kind of comments that you would like to see in a
    review of one of your own papers.

JAIR's review policies are outlined in our Editorial Charter:

   http://www.jair.org/charter.html

Basically we are looking for high-quality papers.  Accepted papers
should be good enough to be published in any first-rank journal.
There is no minimum or maximum length for papers in JAIR, but shorter
papers are preferred.

I look forward to reading your opinion of the paper.
