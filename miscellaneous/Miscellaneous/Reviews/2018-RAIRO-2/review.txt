I don't understand the formulation of the problem (section 3):

The objective is to maximize profit so, according to the notations, P_jvc + P_jvb + P_jvo is the average profit by passenger for the company when using plane v for deserving destination j.

But then I do not see what the constraints represent. I suppose it is some cost limit, but the right hand side parameters (G,D,H) are described as "total expected profits". How can it be that you have constraints that prevent exceeding an expected profit?

Furthermore, constraints (3) does not seem to be homogeneous: the right hand side is a profit (D) but the left side is a profit (Pjvb) multiplied by a price (Pxij). 

In the case study you describe how you compute the average number of seats for each flight (Nxij, in section 4.2.2), the penalty for cancelation (so I suppose it relates to Pjvc in the model, in section 4.2.3) and the penalty for overloading (so I suppose it relates to Pjvo in the model, in section 4.2.4). But you say nothing about the value of the "expected profits" G,D and H and what they actually represent. 

It is also difficult to figure out how in the model you can focus on plane types/kind (it is explicitly said that index v represents a "kind of plane" so in your use-case you have 6 types/kind of planes, so V=6) and not instances of planes (the company probably have more than 1 instance of each type of plane). As a consequence, the conclusions drawn from the study are that some kind of planes should not be used for some destinations; for instance: "Shiraz should cease 3 return flights from Tehran to Shiraz. McDonnell Douglas MD-82, Fokker 100, and Airbus A320-200 airplanes should not be used in these cities". But I suppose that several flights using a Fokker 100 could be schedule to Shiraz and maybe not all of them should be ceased. I do not see how it is possible to restrict the model to the types of planes without considering instances of planes.

You should also give more indication on the size of the mathematical model. In section 4.2.4 you mention 54 airplanes and 300 flights. But it is not clear how these figures translate in term of size of the integer linear model. How many boolean variables x_ijv ? In the use-case you describe, you also have very few destinations so the model does not seem very big (and some statements in section 5 like "Out of approximately 24 flights among these cities, our results showed that only 7 planes would not fly in order to obtain the best revenue" seem to suggest that the model is quite small). So when you say "due to the computational complexity, exact solutions were unable to efficiently solve the problem", I think this would deserve a more detailed explanation.

Some more detailed comments/typos:

p3, section 2: "and have considered flight ticket booking as an option [in] the RM models."
p3, section 2: "t[h]icket". There are several occurrences in the article.
p4, paragraph 2: "the fact that [the] investigating ..."
p4, in Notations: if I is a set (Set of origins), then it cannot be used as an integer in the next line: i = 1,2,...,I. Same for J and V.
p6, paragraph 2: "bel[l]ow"
p7, section 4.1: it seems that you implicitly assume that each flight is to/from Tehran that acts as a central hub. You never mention Tehran in the set of origin/destinations.
p8, section 4.3 (Mathematical model): the subsections 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4 have wrong index, it should be 4.3.x
p10, equation (7): you do not explain with is g_1 and why if as I suppose the addition term estimates a violation, then it should be + sum(...) and not - sum(...) as you want to minimize the violation
p10: "if the constraint to satisfy is h(x)<=g_0": it is not a good idea to use the notation g_0 as it can be confused by the first constraint g_0(x)>=0
p10, equation (8): you do not link with the definitions of V{g(x)>=g_0}, V{g(x)<=g_0} above. What is the link with P(v) ?
p22: this Table 5 (which is 3 pages long!) is very redundant and really not informative

To summarize (1) the formulation of the problem is not clear at all and I'm not even sure it makes sense (though the model itself is very simple), and (2) I'm not convinced that the model is so large that it is justified to use a meta-heuristic to solve it.
