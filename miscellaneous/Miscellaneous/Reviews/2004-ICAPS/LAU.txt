The problem addressed by the authors is clearly relevant and the
proposed approaches (genetic algorithms) also sounds promising.

The main problem with the paper is that it is really unnecessarily
complex and hard to follow. The notations are really misleading and
sometimes, some unnecessary notations are introduced. For instance in
section "Request Historgrams" (sic), a request is defined by a release
date, a deadline, a start time, an end time (denoted e_i whereas in
the section MTP, the end time is denoted t_i), a length and an
allowable shift ! In the complexity section above, it is mentioned
that their are two kinds of time constraints: r_i <= s_i <= r_i + C
and s_i + l_i <= d_i, whereas this last constraint s_i + l_i <= d_i
can trivially be re-written s_i <= r_i + C using the definition d_i =
r_i + l_i + C !

The complexity analysis for MTPs is interesting but here also, the
notations are really bad. For instance, the special case k=n does not
mean, as it is stated, that the problem consists in satisfying all
the requests as a request may have a weight greater than 1.

The section that defines the "request histogram", again, is
unnecessarily complex. For instance, I do not understand what the
notation X[t] for a configuration stands for.

A big effort is spent at defining a mathematical programming
formulation of the problems. The proposed models are interesting but
they are never used except in the experimental results where the main
comment seems to be (but ii is never explicitly said) that the
proposed GAs behave better than the MIP formulation. There is no hint
of how fair is the comparison between GAs and MIP (for small problems,
MIP finds the optimal solution whereas GA fail to find it) and for
real problems, it is not said how much time is allocated to the MIP
to find a solution and not much is said about the actual stop condition
of the GAs.

There is no comment on the experimental results and no conclusion at
all.

The problem name "Military Transportation Problem" should be changed
as there are many military transportation problems that do not fit
into this model and, of course, the model is generic enough to be
applied to many non-military and non-transportation problems !

Summary of review (to author(s) and PC members) *

This paper is about a problem that is very easy to define, it proposes
an easy, intuitive and certainly very relevant approach to solve
it using GAs but it is so badly written that it requires a huge effort
to really understand the contribution. I'm pretty sure that the
contribution is really interesting but the paper should be re-written
with more easy and more clear notations, and a more precise
description and analyze of the experimental results.
