The paper is an improvement on the iterative flattening algorithm
IFlat of Cesta,Oddi&Smith. Starting from an analyze of some limits of
IFlat, the authors propose a very simple change in the algorithm
(namely, allow more than one iteration of the relaxation step) and
show that this change improves the solution quality and the robustness
without affecting the time performances.

The explanation of the limitations of iterative flattening is very
hard to follow. One of the reason (but not the only one) is that the
explanation relies on the use of colors on Figure 6 which is very tiny
... and will certainly appear in blackI and white in the
proceedings. The assertion that the pathological behavior
(under-utilization of resource in the earliest part of the schedule)
often appears in IFlat and is really "pathological" should be better
justified. Indeed, it is after all normal that, for instance a machine
cannot be used at all before the earlier start time of the set of
activities that requires it, and that, just after this date, because
there is not much demand on the resource, it is more difficult to fill
the resource until its maximal capacity. It would be interesting to
provide some indicator of the under-usage of resources in the early
stages of the schedule and to compare the values of this indicator
with IFlat and with IFlatTRelax on the set of instances to show that
the gain in makespan is effectively due to a better usage of resources
in the early stages.



The paper improves on an existing algorithm by analyzing some of its
limitations. The explanation of what is wrong with the original
algorithm should be improved. The proposed improvements are really
simple and the experimental section shows that this change really
improves the results.
