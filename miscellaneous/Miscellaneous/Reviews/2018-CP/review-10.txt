Review:

The article introduces the concept of Episodic Constraint Satisfaction Problems that consists of expressing constraints on the trajectory of state variables over some temporally constrained time intervals. 

Although the paper describes some interesting piece of work (and I encourage the authors to pursue in this direction), it is missing some important references and comparison to existing approaches and the interest of the proposed approach should be explained more in detail.

First, providing a notion of state variable whose trajectory over continuous time can be constrained has been the topic of many approaches based on CP in the past. I think you should compare your approach with them. Here are some of them: 

* Time-line planning and scheduling:

- A. Cesta and S. Fratini. The Timeline Representation Framework as a Planning and Scheduling Software Development Environment. Proc. of 27th Workshop of the UK Planning and Scheduling SIG. 2008.

- ICAPS 2018 tutorial: Timeline-based Planning and Execution: Theory and Practice

In timeline planning and scheduling, state variables are represented as timelines and constraints are expressed on the trajectories of these timelines.

* Temporal planning systems like IxTeT ("events" and "hold" predicates): 

- M. Ghallab and H. Laruelle. Representation and Control in IxTeT, a Temporal Planner. Proc. AIPS 1994.

This planning system provides the notion of events (a variable date, as in the present paper) and "hold" conditions/constraints on temporal intervals over some state variables/fluents, with continuous time and temporal constraints between events, just like in the proposed approach.

More generally, temporal planning approaches (as expressed in the PDDL2.1 language for instance) offer a rich expressivity for encoding and solving problems like the ones treated in the present paper.

* CP systems with explicit time representation like CP Optimizer (especially the notion of state function):

- P. Laborie, J. Rogerie, P. Shaw, P. Vilim. Reasoning with Conditional Time-Intervals. Part II: An Algebraical Model for Resources. Proc. FLAIRS 2009.
- P. Laborie, J. Rogerie, P. Shaw, P. Vilim. IBM ILOG CP optimizer for scheduling. Constraints, Volume 23, Issue 2, pp 210–250. 2018.

In particular, CP Optimizer deals with continuous time and introduces the notion of state function to constrain the trajectory of state variables over time. With constraints similar to uniform episodes ("alwaysIn" constraints) and constant episodes ("alwaysEqual", "alwaysConstant" constraints). This CP engine also uses efficient representations and propagation algorithms on the Simple Temporal Network.

I think it would be necessary to position the present work in the context of these approaches. 

The approach is restricted to time-insensitive ECSPs. But it is not exactly clear what kind of constraints can be expressed on the state variables. The examples only show range constraints like c>=0, c=2, 0<=numP<=4. I suppose the framework can handle more complex constraints. COuld you describe them more formally and give some examples? It would be good to make it more explicit and also to formalize the distinction between time-sensitive and time-insensitive constraint.

My understanding is that the proposed approach can permit very rich constraints on the episodes (provided they are time-insensitive) that cannot be easily handled by existing CP frameworks like CP Optimizer (that will mostly handle range constraints on the state variables) but you should give convincing examples of such complex constraints.

The resolution approach relies on successive layers of decisions:
1- Generate total orders of events (satisfying symbolical constraints/precedences)
2- Check (quantitative) temporal constraints
3- Check state constraints

A clear drawback of this approach is that it may enforce some order on some events that are in fact quite independent and this may generate a lot of symmetries. It is also missing some propagation from the lower levels at the top level. Did you consider using a full constraint propagation (quantitative temporal constraints + state constraints) at each level ? In particular, in the basic example used in the paper, propagating the state function right at the top level (like a CP model with state functions would do) would detect the precedence Ready <= Start1 and avoid any backtracking for solving the problem.

The problem studied in the experimental section looks interesting but it is not described sufficiently in detail to justify the interest of the introduced formalism. I could not find the reference [3] (this reference seems to provide some details on this problem) on the AAAI-2018 conference page.

Typos and more detailed comments:

- End of section 2.3: cited reference [1] does not seem to provide much support for the statement that encoding time-insensitive ECSPs in CP is non-intuitive.
- Fig.2 is missing in the paper.
