Review:

The paper first recap the formalism of temporal planning with chronicles. This formalism, first introduced in the IxTeT planning system is very expressive for temporal planning problems as each chronicle can model a complex action with temporally constrained effects and conditions.

The main contribution of the paper is an encoding of the problem of temporal planning with chronicles as a CSP. Following previous approaches for encoding planning problems as CSPs, the overall resolution consists of producing an envelope of possible actions/chronicles and decide, in the CSP, which ones will be present/absent in the plan and, for the present ones, fix their variables (both temporal and non-temporal variables). The very interesting point about temporal planning with chronicles is that the resulting CSP is very close to classical constraint-based scheduling problems that recently introduced the notions of optional intervals/activities and provide efficient constraint propagation algorithms (and search algorithms) to reason about these optional variables. 

The paper is well written and manages, in a few pages, to formally describe the chronicle formalism (illustrated on an example) and the CSP encoding that is proposed.

One could consider the experimental section as a weak point of the paper because it only considers a few problems and the results are not really impressive. But I think it is clearly because of the CSP encoding that is too low level and does not target a constraint-based scheduling model specialized on the resolution of temporal problems (as mentioned by the authors in section 6).

The work described in this paper is clearly at an early stage because, as remarked by the authors in the section about related work, the current CSP encoding does not take advantage of the existing (or possible extensions of) global constraints in constraint-based scheduling. In particular, the constraints on state variables are very similar to the notion of 'state function' in CP Optimizer (state variables are more similar to this notion than to the notion of unary resource mentioned in the paper). There are some difference still, as in CP Optimizer, state functions do not distinguish between effects and conditions so the semantics is slightly different but there is no doubt that state functions could be extended to handle conditions and effects as specified in the chronicles. This is a very interesting perspective and, to me, this is the only thing that currently prevents an easy encoding of the chronicles into a constraint-based scheduling system. 

I really like the paper because it shows how to close the gap between complex and expressive temporal planning and recent constraint-based scheduling approaches with optional intervals. And even if the results are still not here, it shows a very interesting path.

Here are some more detailed comments and typos:

- p3, in the description of chronicles: the events are defined on an interval [s,e]. Why is 's' important for an event? Is it because as the state is considered to be undefined on ]s,e[, no assumption can be made on the state over this interval. Note that this looks very similar to the notion of "no-state" in CP Optimizer's state functions.

- p5, in section 3.1, in the description of the effect tokens, you say that a new time-point t is introduced to encode the persistence of the state produced by the event. This time-point t is not explicit in the chronicle formalism. Would it make sense to make it explicit in the event definition, so as for instance to specify a minimal or maximal time for the persistence?

- p6, section 3.2 about coherence constraint: what if two effect tokens produce the save value (v=v'). I suppose that, as suggested by the formulas, the two tokens are also in disjunction ...

- p6, section 3.2: the notation p for the presence value and p1,...,pn for the parameters (both use p) is a bit misleading even if it is clear depending on the context. May be it would be better to use two different letters. Also, you could use parenthesis in the formulas p and p' => ... and in the formula for suported-by in the bottom of page 6. This would facilitate the parsing of the equations. Also I think there is a typo and one should read "sup[p]orted-by"

- p9, line 3: "of the resulting [the] CSP is checked ..."

- p9, section 5.1: "The rational[e] ..."
