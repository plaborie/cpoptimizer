The approach interesting but I find the added value quite small compared with reference [8]. Is it only the proof that H2 verifies the connectivity property? The property is important but quite intuitive as the approach boils down to 3 parallel "deterministic" problems.

I think the fact the proposed 'maximum' operator between TFN is only an approximation should be better motivated. What do we really loose using such an approximation ?

It seems to be possible to generalize the approach to more complex fuzzy numbers with more than 3 points. For instance would it make sense to use more general concave continuous piecewise linear function with null value at the two extremities of their definition domain ? As long as the sum and max operations can be defined as respectively the sum and max of the set of n points defining the function most of the ingredients of the approach could be valid (definition of critical arcs using n parallel disjunctive graphs, connectivity property, etc.).

A few more detailed comments:

- section 3, in job-shop problems one more often see the term "operation" than "task" to define the components of a job.

- section 3.1: in the first paragraph, the notion of "task processing order" \sigma is never formally defined.

- Figure 2: it would help to also have the earliest start values on the nodes as a triplet of integers.

-p5: simmulated -> simulated
