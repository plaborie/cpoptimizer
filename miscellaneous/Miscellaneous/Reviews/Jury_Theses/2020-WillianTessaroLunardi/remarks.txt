REMARKS:

It was a great pleasure for me to interact with Willian,

He is someone very motivated and enthusiastic,

CP Optimizer was something completely new to him and I must say that he learned it very fast and in deep



Manuscript:

- In general, I find that the manuscript is very well written and very very clear, thanks to many relevant figures (in particular in the section presenting the problem).

- I think it is also a very good idea to have a special section on the abbreviations at the very beginning



QUESTIONS:


- Fig 5.13: Perf CPO against Meta-heuristics on large OPS instances (LOPS). The gap between the methods is very large here (more than 10% in makespan).
  By curiosity, I'd like to understand better. Is it because CP Optimizer is really worse on a couple of instances? Is it balanced over all instances ?
  Is there a problem when exploiting the result of the first step (optimization of the simpler version of the problem?).
  I think there is something to dig here.



- Objective: really makespan minimization?



- General question: from the perspective of the application, if you were to start your PhD again, what would you do in a different way ?



- Did you compare your meta-heuristics also against CP Optimizer on the classical flexible job-shop instances ?
  I did not see this comparison in the manuscript. Also, on these instances, did you manage to improve some best known upper-bounds?


- Table A.4: The results for the "edata" instances of Hurink, Jurisch, and Thole seem strange, the makespan do not correspond to the ones reported in other papers.

- Fig. 2.1: I don't think the Open Shop can be considered as a generalization of Job Shop or Flow Shop. You cannot represent a Job Shop as a (classical) Open Shop problem as Open shop has not the notion of precedence constraints between operations.

- "The FJS scheduling problem, also known as the JS scheduling problem with duplicate
    machines, first introduced by Nuijten and Aarts (1996)". I think the FJS was introduced earlier, see at least:

REMARKS:
Manuscript:


- In the Tables (like 4.2) giving the number of variables in the CP Optimizer model, I guess one should read "Interval variables" instead of "Integer variables" as column name

- "While the MILP solver is a general-purpose solver; the CP Optimizer solver was born
as a solver dedicated to scheduling problems, with its own modeling language that
fully explores the structure of the underlying problem."
Just be careful, CP Optimizer is not only dedicated to scheduling. There are also "classical" integer variables and global constraints (like allDifferent)
and it is also used in applications outside of the scheduling scope. For instance for configuration problems,
