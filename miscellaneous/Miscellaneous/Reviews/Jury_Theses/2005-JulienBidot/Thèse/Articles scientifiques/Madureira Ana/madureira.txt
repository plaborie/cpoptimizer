4. Comments, explanations, and advice to the authors:

The main reason for rejecting this paper is that it is not relevant to
on-line scheduling.  The paper goes into detail about a tabu search
mechanism for scheduling for 6 pages and then on one page talks about
on-line scheduling without providing new information: simply that a
new static problem can be defined and the previous framework can be
used to solve it.  Furthermore, it is not clear that the on-line
scheduling is the same framework as the static framework: in the
on-line part, the authors suddenly begin talking about chromosomes and
genes as if the solution technique is a genetic algorithm. No mention
(much less a definition) of GAs, chromosomes, or genes are given.

To comment on the framework, I have strong doubts as to the quality of
the scheduling solutions that it would produce. It is based on
decomposition to single machine problems, independent tabu search on
the single machine problems, and then a very straightforward
"coordination" mechanism that combines the individual machine
schedules. I am very skeptical about this approach and would need to
see some strong empirical evidence that it is able to solve problems
with any degree of performance.  I strongly believe that existing,
simple approaches such as tabu over the whole problem (without
decomposition), constraint programming, and even simple dispatch rules
(shortest processing time first) would result in better scheduling.
Of course, I could be very wrong, so I encourage the authors to take
an empirical approach and demonstrate the strengths of their
framework.

Minor comments:

There are a number of English mistakes and typographical errors:
"unfeasible" -> "infeasible", "addings" -> "additions"

p1: "due to their dynamic nature, real scheduling problems have an
additional complexity in relation to static ones".  Is this a
mathematical use of the word "complexity"? It seems to me that the
authors may be claiming that dynamic problems have a higher
computational complexity that static ones. If so, it should be
justified. If not, perhaps, "real scheduling problems are more
complicated than static ones" is a better phrasing.

p3: What is "RNDLS"? It is not defined.

p3: "50 e 60 jobs" 

p4: "MetaHeuristics such as ... Neural Networks". I don't believe that
neural nets are commonly considered metaheuristics.

p4: It seems to indicate that the tabu list length is size 2. Is this
true? There are only two moves on the tabu list? This is a very short
list from the perspective of most tabu search algorithms for
scheduling. 10 or 15 is much more common. Why so small?
