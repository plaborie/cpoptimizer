4. Comments, explanations, and advice to the authors:

The main issue I have with this paper is deciding whether it is really
relevant to the workshop.  It does not directly address on-line
scheduling. Rather it addresses off-line techniques that reason about
temporal uncertainty and establish guarantees about on-line
schedulability. In terms of the quality of the work, this paper is a
clear "accept", I remain undecided only because of the relevance for
which I have two conflicting arguments:

1) Reject as irrelevant: there is nothing in the paper that actually
   addresses "doing" on-line scheduling. It is about (partial)
   off-line scheduling.
2) Accept as related and strong: the work is clearly well-done and the
   topic is related. It is clearly useful if given the task of on-line
   scheduling to be able to do some off-line work and come up with
   guarantees (if they exist).


The paper is heavy going in places. Keeping track of all the notations
is not easy and it is not always clear what the figures mean (for
example, what do the dotted arrows indicate?). Perhaps, the actual
mathematical expressions of the classical (non-uncertain) rules can be
left out. That is, introduce the classical rule with an example, and
then simply show (with an example and math) how this is applied to the
uncertain case.  It is a bit discouraging to wade through a set of
equations and understand the rule, only to realize at the end that
this is not the "real" point of the paper, only background.

In a related point, some of the classical rules are traditionally
formulated for task interval algebra rather than STPs. As a
consequence to apply them to STNU, the authors first apply it to
STN. More explanatory text is needed so that the reader understands
what you are doing. You need to say: "This has not been extended to
the STN, we need to do this first before extending to the STNU. Here
is the STN extension."

In the conclusion: it is stated that the STN formulation results in
"more deductions made". I do not dispute this, but it is unclear where
this is shown in the paper. If you are claiming that a STN version of
a classical rule is stronger, it should be made clearer (with an
example?) in the text. (Note that this also relates to the relevance
of the paper: the extension to STN is interesting in its own right,
but not relevant to on-line scheduling).

Minor comments:

Abstract: "most flexibility" -> "much flexibility"

p1: "wheather" -> "whether"

p2: "implicitely" -> "implicitly"

p2: "put in short" -> "in short"

p3: "work made up to now" -> "existing work"

p3: "mentionned" -> "mentioned"

p3: no space before ":"

p4: "only if a lower bound ... is found positive" -> "is positive".

p4: "fordids" -> "forbids"

p8: "stronly" -> "strongly"

5.  Additional comments:

Acceptance here depends on number of papers and how wide we want to
make the workshop. If we want to go toward "scheduling with
uncertainty" this is clearly an acceptable paper.  If we really want
to focus on techniques for doing on-line scheduling, then this paper
doesn't fit: it is not doing on-line scheduling, it is doing off-line
scheduling. 

It is a high quality paper, otherwise.
