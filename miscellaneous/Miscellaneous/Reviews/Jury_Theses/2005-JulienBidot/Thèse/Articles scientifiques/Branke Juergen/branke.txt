4. Comments, explanations, and advice to the authors:

I think this is a very nice paper and strongly recommend
acceptance. Given this positive attitude, I would like to play
"devil's advocate" for my "Major Comments" here: that is, I would like to
be rather extreme in my criticisms, with the purpose that the authors
can use and respond to these criticisms to strengthen the paper (and
their future work). In no way should my criticisms be interpreted to
mean that I think the paper should not be accepted.

Major comments:

The central claim of the paper is that an explicit "flexibility"
measure should be part of an optimization criteria in a dynamic
scheduling problem.  They claim that:
1) A measure of early idle time is (or can be used as) a measure of
   flexibility. 
2) The performance of the overall system in terms of minimizing summed
   tardiness is a valid measure of the impact of increasing the
   schedule flexibility.

The authors have presented no evidence that early idle time or their
experimental results are related in any way to flexibility. To me, a
flexible schedule is one in which changes (such as the arrival of new
jobs) can be easily incorporated.  The easy incorporation of a change
can have a variety of measures. Two obvious ones are:
- small perturbations: The schedule incorporating the change is very
  similar to the schedule before the change. The ideal situation is
  that none of the existing activities have changed their start
  times/resource assignments.
- fast re-scheduling: The solving of the dynamic problem when a change
  happens is very fast.

On an intuitive basis, I agree that idle time should be related to
these two example measurements of flexibility: if I have a lot of idle
time in my schedule, I can probably place the activities in the new job
where ever I want without changing the assignments of the existing
jobs.  However, to me this is clearly a secondary measurement and it
is not clear to me that idle time is the only way to achieve
flexibility. Therefore, a more direct measure of flexibility is
needed.

The evaluation of the system performance is also troublesome as it is
claimed that it is the flexibility (as represented by the increased
early idle time) that results in the higher performance on mean summed
tardiness.  I would suggest a different reason for the performance
gain but first I need to explain my understanding of the
experimentation.
- An initial schedule is created with the set of known jobs and the
  "execution" of this schedule begins.
- A some point a new job arrives. All the already executed and in
  process activities are removed from the scheduling problem, the new
  job is added and a new solution is found.
- When the final activity in a job executes, the contribution to the
  summed tardiness is calculated. (And as a detail only the "middle"
  300 jobs are used for the summed tardiness to avoid distortion).

Imagine an existing job, A,  whose final activity falls inside the
beta-interval and another existing job, B, whose final activity is after
the beta-interval.  Given an executing schedule, it is far more likely
that the final job in A will execute before rescheduling (due to the
arrival of a new job) than that the final activity in B will execute.
Since the contribution of a job to the cost only happens when it is
finished executing, when I am creating a schedule any jobs that will
finish far in the future are essentially irrelevant to the cost: I know
that I will reschedule before I have to execute the final activity in
B.  Therefore, *any* fitness function that will tend to focus attention
in the near term, will tend to increase performance. To make a
concrete prediction: consider replacing the S term in your fitness
function by a second summed tardiness term that is defined over the
beta-interval (in the same way that your S term is).  That is, treat
the tardiness of the jobs that are expected to finish over the
beta-interval as more important that the tardiness of the whole
schedule. I predict that the performance gains will be even greater
than the ones you found in the paper.

Just to be clear: I believe there is another explanation for your
performance increase that has nothing to do with flexibility. By
adding a term to your fitness function that tends to minimize early
tardiness you are simply raising the relative importance of the early
schedule quality (low idleness correlates with low tardiness!). This
accounts for your results. My suggestion is to explicitly include
early schedule quality in your fitness function rather than the
idleness term, and see what happens.

A further comment along the same lines is to investigate overall
performance measures that are not strongly correlated with low
idleness. For example, summed earliness/tardiness.  Here, early idle
time can clearly be detrimental to the overall performance of the
schedule.  Therefore, if you get performance increases, it is more
likely that it is indeed the flexibility introduced by the early
idleness that is the basis for your performance increases.

Minor comments:

Dynamic scheduling seems to have different definitions. I have seen it
used in the GA community simply to mean that the release dates of all
jobs is not 0, but that all jobs are known before scheduling. This is
not the case here: jobs become known during the execution of the
schedule, resulting in the need for rescheduling. This should be made
clear early in the paper. It was not until I was half way through that
I was confident that the paper really address "on-line" scheduling.

Is the release time equal to the time at which the job becomes known?

p2: It would be nice to add some more comments on the "distortion"
effects that you want to circumvent by only using the middle 300 jobs
in your evaluation.

p3: 2nd last paragraph: "but early idle times" -> "and early idle
times"

p6: "where machine capacity is no scarce resource" -> "where machine
capacity is readily available"

5.  Additional comments:

I would be interested to continue discussion with the authors over
their interpretation of the results and new ideas. If you feel it is
appropriate, you can reveal that I was the reviewer and that they can
contact me.

As I stressed early in my comments, I think this paper should
definitely be accepted.
