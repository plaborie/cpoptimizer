Reasons for wishing to attend the school (max 100 words)

In the frame of my Ph.D. thesis with ILOG (PLANET's member) and L.G.P./E.N.I.T.
(Tarbes/France) I am investigating robust scheduling with uncertainty.

During the plan execution some uncertain events, which are not always taken into
account a priori, occur and can dramatically affect the plan quality and
feasibility.

My research consists in finding relevant models and algorithms for this problem,
which is at the intersection of temporal planning, scheduling, and execution.

I would like to attend this summer school in order to get a further knowledge in
scheduling and execution, and acquire a strong basic knowledge in planning.


   
I would like to display a poster (yes/no) yes

Title of poster: uncertainty models for robust scheduling
