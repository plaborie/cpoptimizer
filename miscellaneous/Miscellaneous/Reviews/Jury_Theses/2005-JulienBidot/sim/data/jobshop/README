This directory contains a set of instances for the job-shop scheduling
problem. Each file contains the data for one instance. Each file consists of
a line containing the number of jobs and the number of machines, followed by
one line for each job, listing the machine number and processing time for
each operation of the job, respectively. The machines are numbered starting
with 0. As an example we give ft06:

 6  6
 2   1  0   3  1   6  3   7  5   3  4   6 
 1   8  2   5  4  10  5  10  0  10  3   4 
 2   5  3   4  5   8  0   9  1   1  4   7 
 1   5  0   5  2   5  3   3  4   8  5   9 
 2   9  1   3  4   5  5   4  0   3  3   1 
 1   3  3   3  5   9  0  10  4   4  2   1 

This means that 6 jobs and 6 machines are given, and that the first job
consists of 6 operations that are to be scheduled in sequence, respectively
on machine 2 with processing time 1, on machine 0 with processing time 3 etc.

Experiment files were named according to the following template: 

	eXddrY-Z

where X=0 : RG=0 (all due dates and release dates are the same)
      X=n : RG=0.1 (narrow range of due dates and release dates)
      X=w : RG=0.2 ("wide" range of due dates and release dates)
      Y=1 : 1 a priori bottleneck
      Y=2 : 2 a priori bottlenecks
      Z=1..10: experiment index within a given class of problems

Additional details on the test suite can be found in my
PhD dissertation (Chapter 3, pp. 60-61):
"Look-ahead Techniques for Micro-opportunistic Job-Shop Scheduling", 
Norman Sadeh, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 
Pittsburgh, PA 15213, March 1991. 

A copy of my dissertation can be ordered from the School of Computer
Science (Please contact Catherine Copetas: copetas@cs.cmu.edu) or
from UMI (1-800-521-0600, ext.:3451, publication number:9126962)

The ORR and FSS heuristics described in my dissertation combined
with simple backtrack heuristics can solve all 60 problems
(see Robotics Institute CMU-RI-TR-92-06, which can be ordered
by contacting Marce Zaragoza at mz01+@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-3733).
CPU time is generally under 100 sec. on a DECstation5000 running
Knowledge Craft 3.3 on top of Allegro Common Lisp. In a recent
reimplementation of the code in C++, most problems are solved
in about 1 CPU second (a 30-fold speedup is simply attributed to
rewriting the code in C++, the remaining performance improvement
was obtained by speeding up the computation of demand profiles 
used by the ORR and FSS heuristics).
