We present here some results of the jobshop study of extended
propagation with three methods. We say <<iteratively>> for repeating the
mapping of the activities until only a few and sparse ones are changed.
(i.e. no more than one per resource).
	bounds:	we set the start and the end of each activities to be the
		values for which a solution is possible and this iteratively.
	ranks :	we try to rank not first (resp rank not last) all the 
		possible first (resp possible last) and this iteratively.
	mixed : first the rank method then the bounds one. We choose three
		kinds of mixing of method:
			act mix   : on each activity, 
			sched mix : a cycle of ranks then a cycle of bounds  
			ranks+bounds: ranks iteratively then bounds iteratively

The mixing methods needs the same or nearly the same number of choice points
than the bounds one and generally a CPU time intermediate between the two
method (eventually a mix method is a little bit better than the best pure one)

The test choose the same heuristic for the resolution method, the only change
is a cll the to extra propagation nethod before each choice point.

We give for each studied problem the results when no method, the bounds
one and the best in CPU time mixed one

Note 1: when we try not to iterate (only one cycle on the activity), 
	we obtain no more than twice choice points but about the 
	same CPU comsumption.
Note 2: We have observed no more than about three iterations 
	even for hard problem (la21).
Note 3: On ft10 and car5 we don't have any change in the number of choice
	points when we exit the iteration only at the fix point.

Note 4: we have began to complete the rank method to not possible first and
	rank activities with a <<better tight set>> search which
	give an order of 20% to 30% less choice points than pure rank search.
