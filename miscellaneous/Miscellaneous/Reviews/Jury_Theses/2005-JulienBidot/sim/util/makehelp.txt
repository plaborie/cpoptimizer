
Possible targets:

  - [nothing]    Builds the product library
  
  - bench        Builds the library and runs all the benches
  
  - diff         Compares the results of the benches to those in refbench
  
  - clean        Deletes everything

  - keeplib      Deletes everything except the library itself

  - benchXXX     Benches are grouped by categories, defined in the files bench.rule
                 in the bench directories (examples/src, examples/bench, ...)
                 This launches all the benches in the corresponding category.
                 
Possible options

  - DEBUG and NDEBUG: Debugging options
      
     Under Unix: The default value of the DEBUG macro is such that full optimization
                 of the code is on, and no debugging information is stored.
                 Exemple: -O3 -DNDEBUG
                 By default, NDEBUG is empty. The most frequent use of those options
                 is to specify DEBUG=-g, but the two macros can be combined freely.
                 
     On Windows: Things are slightly more complicated. 
                 Doing 'nmake DEBUG=' switches to debug mode.
                 If you want to specify your own debug/optim related options, either
                 use 'nmake DEBUG=MyOwnDebugOption' to *add* something to the default 
                 debug mode, or use 'nmake DEBUG= NDEBUG=MyOwnDebugOption' to *replace*
                 the default debug mode.
                 If you just want to have the asserts, but not a full debug mode, use 
                 'nmake NDEBUG='

  - LIBS         If you specify 'LIBS=' on the command line, then the library will not
                 be recompiled, even if the object files are missing or the sources
                 have changed.
                 [ Other uses of this option do not work correctly :-( ]
                 
  - OPTIONS      All purpose macro. Its default value is empty, and it is usually used
                 to define specific compilation flags.
                 
  - TMPDIR       [ I do not know how to use this option ]
