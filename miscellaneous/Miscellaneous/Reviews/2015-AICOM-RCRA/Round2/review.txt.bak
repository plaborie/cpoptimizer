Narrative: (sent to corresponding author and other reviewers)

This version of the article satisfactorily answers my main concern about analyzing the impact of the different ingredients of the DE approach on the permutation flow-shop problem. 

I have a couple of minor suggestions for the authors:
- the proposed meta-heuristic approach aims at providing good solutions and upper-bounds to the problem, it cannot provide lower bounds or prove optimality. That's why I do not understand the mention of "new known optima" in the abstract. It seems to mean "new upper bounds that improve on the state-of-the-art". I would suggest to change this sentence.
- on a similar line, on end of page 10: "and, more remarkably, in 45 cases they are the <new known best values> with respect to [5]". I suppose you precisely mean that these values were not known before the work described in the current paper, so I would rather say that in 45 cases the best known solution reported in [5] were improved. 
- on Table 4, you denote with a start "*" symbol the cases were you improved the upper bound. Usually in optimization, the start "*" notation is used to denote a proved optimal solution, which is clearly not the case here. So to avoid confusion, I would suggest to use another typographical notation.
