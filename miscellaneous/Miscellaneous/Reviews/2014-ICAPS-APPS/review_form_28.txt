This short paper describes a very original application that consists in using AI Planning techniques (1) to identify inconsistency in the data and (2) to propose some alternative recourse actions to reconciliate inconsistent data.

The paper is clearly written. One thing that could be improved would be to explicitly describe (or at least give an idea) of the types of fluents that are used to describe a state in the planning problem of the application. For instance I suppose that there is some fluent to count the number of part-time contracts, in order to ensure that constraint c2 is respected, etc. That would help to understand what sorts of states are in the set G of "inconsistent" states.

In section 3 (p3, end of col 1), maybe the term "feasible event sequence" is a bit misleading as it could be interpreted as "consistent event sequence". Maybe you could just remove "feasible".
