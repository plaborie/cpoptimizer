The article tackle a very significant planning and scheduling problem in the context of mining. The problem is to allocate blocks to excavators and stockpiles while respecting several types of constraints (spatial constraints, blending constraints for stockpiles, limited number of excavators, travel times) and minimizing the makespan.

The problem is decomposed in two phases: first a planning problem, mostly for allocating blocks to stockpiles, and then a detailed scheduling problem. This type of decomposition approach is quite common for solving complex planing and scheduling problem. The planning problem is solved as a MIP problem whereas the scheduling problem uses AI Planning. 

There are several ambiguities in the description of the problem. I think the problem should be described more formally in the "Problem Description" section. For instance:
- It is not clear if a block needs to be allocated a single stockpile or if it can be split between several ones. The informal description of the problem and the figures 3 and 4 seem to suggest a single stockpile whereas the fact in the MIP variables x_b,d are continuous suggest that it can be split
- The temporal constraints due to block accessibility constraints are not clear. In the end it seems that for a given block, they are given as a *disjunctive* set of subset of cleared blocks: in the example \Gamma(b)={{i,j},{j,k}} means that b should be mined (after i and j) OR (after j and k). 

I'm surprised AI Planning was used to solve the second phase of the problem. Once the blocks have been allocated to the stockpiles (in the planning phase), the problem is a pure scheduling problem with resource allocation: all the tasks are known, it is only a matter of allocating the block mining tasks to the excavators and sequencing the tasks on the excavators. The travel times of excavators are sequence-dependent setup times which is something very common in scheduling. The only "non-classical" constraints are the temporal constraints with disjunction but this is something that can be modeled quite easily in modern schedulers. For instance why not to use Constraint Programming to solve this scheduling problem? If you use CPLEX 12.5, it would be interesting to try a scheduling model solved with the CP Optimizer engine that comes with CPLEX 12.5. The disjunctive precedence constraint can easily be modeled with optional interval variables. And the scheduling problems described in the paper look tiny for this type of tools. 

On the same line, in the introduction, nothing is said about constraint-based scheduling (CBS). CBS techniques have shown to be very expressive and efficient to solve scheduling problems, which are problems for which, indeed, MIP is often not well adapted. Compared to AI Planning techniques, CBS exploit the particularities of the problem, in particular the fact the set of tasks to execute if quite well known, in order to perform stronger inference and adapted search strategies.
