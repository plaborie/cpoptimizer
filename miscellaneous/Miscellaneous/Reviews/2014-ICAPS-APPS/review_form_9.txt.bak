The paper compares two scheduling policies in the context of assigning and scheduling service requests to workers while trying to balance two incompatible objectives: maximizing service quality (SLA success) and maximizing skill on-job acquisition by workers. 

The application domain is quite original and interesting. 

The main contribution of the paper is a study of how different (and relatively simple) greedy on-line scheduling policies behave with respect to the two performance indicators (SLA success and skill progression) for a given model. No advanced planning or scheduling technique is used in the paper and, even if the system is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, the MDP is not solved or optimized but is only used for a simulation purpose. That's why I find that the contribution is a bit weak for an ICAPS application paper. Maybe a better target for this type of paper would be for a conference more focused on simulation.

More advanced planning and scheduling techniques can be used if the problem makes it possible to allocate more than one SR at a time; for instance by waiting that a batch of SR is available before actually allocating the workers. Another opportunity for using more advanced planning and scheduling techniques is if it is possible to change the worker allocation for past SRs that have still not been processed. But this does not seem to be in the scope of the present paper.

The description of the model in section 2 seems to be quite incomplete. The model focuses on the time it takes to complete a SR depending on the skills but it says nothing about how the skill levels increase because of learning. Furthermore, the formula (1) is not homogeneous as it compares skill level gaps (dist) and durations (timeGap) and highly depends on the units. How is it handled in practice? Formula (2) seems to implicitly assume that \gamma is in [0,1] ...

The Markov Decision Process also lacks some formalization, in particular the reward function is only sketched. But I take it that this is because the reward function is not really used in the approach as in fact the MDP is only used for simulation: there is not any optimization of the MDP in order to produce an optimal (or good) policy. This being said, it would be useful to formalize some key performance indicators in order to compare the different policies. The evolution of SLA success rate as illustrated on Figure 3 is sufficient but there is no formalized indicator for the other main objective functions which are the learning rate / skill progression / good repartition of skills.
