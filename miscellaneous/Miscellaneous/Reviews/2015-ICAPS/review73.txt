The paper describes the use of an AI Planning model to generate the structure of some automatically composed musical pieces. 

Not being an expert in musicology, I will not comment here the properties of the targeted structure itself but the way AI planning is used to generate it.

And in fact, unless I'm really missing something, I do not see the reason why AI planning is being used here. 

First, considering the problem and the proposed model, it is clear that the number of actions in the plan is known in advance and equal to the number of phrases (each action take one clear phrase and process it). So one could as well take the phrases pi in the chronological order and randomly select with which type of operator they are related with one of their randomly selected (or not) predecessor (p1...pi-1). I do not see where AI Planning helps for doing that. And in the tree approach, the top/down approach could work the same. If more complex constraints need to be modeled between the different layers of the tree, then one could typically use a constraint-programming based approach, this resembles a lot what is being done to solve configuration problems [1]. 

The second problem is that the generation of structures as described in the paper fundamentally requires some variety and that this variety is injected into the structure thanks to randomness. In this sense, randomness is essential in the problem. But the role of AI planning (or any other optimization technique) is not to generate randomness, it is to optimize a criterion (randomness may be produced, but it is just a side-effect of the techniques used under the hood by the resolution engine). So it is critical that the optimization criterion models what is expected from a "good" structure. In the proposed model, only a constant cost per action type is mentioned. So if the planning system is efficient, it will only use the cheapest actions. If as mentioned in one section the variation operator has the lowest cost, an optimal plan will only use variation operators (otherwise, it means that the planning system is not efficient enough to compute an optimal solution). If several types of operators have the same cost, it completely depends on the system how ties will be broken (this may result in some randomness being injected in the solution but it is completely accidental). Of course you could think of much more complex optimization criterion that takes into account more global notions that characterize a "good" structure but I fear it can be very challenging to model them in an AI planning model.

So I have two questions:

1. Could you elaborate on what is the real added value of AI planning in your context?

2. Could you describe a bit more in detail how the action costs are selected? From my understanding, considering your current AI planning model, action costs are not needed because in a good solution (in the sense of the optimization criterion) all actions with a cost higher than the minimal action cost should not be used (if the planner is smart enough) so they can be removed from the model.
