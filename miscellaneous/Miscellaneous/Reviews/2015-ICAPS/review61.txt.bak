The paper describes an important planning and scheduling problem for the operation of air separation units used to supply oxygen, nitrogen and argon to a steel production plant. 

The problem is well described and motivated (in particular the relationships/separation between the production stage and the supply stage. The problem tackled by the paper is the supply part). 

The simplifications of the original problem are clearly identified and they seem to be well justified. In the end, the problem is modeled and solved as a MILP. 

In general, the paper is clearly written and well organized.

The individual ingredients of the MILP model are not really new but their combination (state automaton + state persistence + mass conservation in tanks) is, to the best of my knowledge, fairly original.

My main comment is that the paper ends in the experimental section in a very abrupt way (could it be that it is missing some part?). In particular:
- It does not really say how the proposed solutions were considered by the client. Did the proposed solution appeared realistic enough that it justifies a posteriori the simplifications used in the model ? What about the robustness: did you work with a single instance from the customer ?
- The paper does not really deliver the promise made in the introduction to explain how the approach can extend to a broader context ("We then identify key characteristics of the problem that extend to the broader context of planning and scheduling for support plane")

More detailed comments

* Although it is not a big problem because the explanations are clear enough, it would be nicer to use the same values for the operating point percentages in the initial description (currently off, 30%, 60%, 90%, 100%), on figure 1 and 2 (off, 50%, 100%) and in the experiments (off,50%,90%,100%).

* p5, typo in description of variable y_{i,j,t}: "if" ASU i enters state j ...

* p6, in description of variable z^o_t(l): "at times we will z^o_t(l) ... " ?

* p8, paragraph "Demands Used": "the the"
