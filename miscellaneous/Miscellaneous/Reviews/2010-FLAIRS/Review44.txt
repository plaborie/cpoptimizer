*** REVIEW FORM ID: 294193::152747
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 44
*** TITLE: New Modeling for the Total Tardiness Scheduling Problem using Constraint Programming
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie
--------------------------------------------------------------
*** REVIEW:

The paper describes a model for a one machine total tardiness
scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times using
constraint-based scheduling (namely, it is implemented using IBM ILOG
Scheduler). The model is quite straightforward and I do not understand
the claim in the introduction saying that when the objective is a sum
of tardiness, modeling the problem is harder. No, when the objective
is a sum, it is not harder to model, it is just much harder to
solve. The problem is that the paper mostly focuses on the model
(which is, as said above, quite straightforward). There is no real
contribution on the search aspects as the experimental part is only
about trying several search strategies provided in the commercial
product. Furthermore, as these strategies only explore a unique search
tree, the results are not very good (which is not surprising) and in
any case, cannot be compared with the state-of-the-art on this type of
problem that use meta-heuristics. It would have been interesting to
try search strategies that mix meta-heuristics and search tree
exploration using CP. For instance I quickly tried modeling and
solving the problem with the default search provided in IBM ILOG CP
Optimizer (IBM's second generation CP engine [1]); the model is simple
(about 10 lines in OPL) and the default search gets results quite
comparable with the state of the art.

I think there are some minor flaws in the paper:

- in section 3.2, it is said that the initial setup time is used as a
  minimal start time for each activity. This is correct if the setup
  time matrix satisfies the triangular inequality but can over-constrain
  the problem in the general case. Suppose you have two activities A1
  (type 1) and A2 (type 2) of processing time 10 with a setup time such
  that S01=5, S12=5 and S02=30. Then 30 cannot be used as minimal start
  time of A2 because if A1 is scheduled before, A2 will be able to start
  at 5+10+5=20.

- I do not see why you ruled out the ranking and sequencing search
  goals from the experiments. If they are combined with a SetTime goal,
  like for instance IloRankForward(...) && IloSetTimesForward(...) they
  will lead to different results than the SetTimes alone as the top of
  the search tree will consist of ordering decisions. It is not clear if
  the results would be better but I do not see any reason to rule these
  goals out in the study.

*** REMARKS FOR THE PROGRAMME COMMITTEE:

There is really nothing new in this paper. It is just the trivial
modelization of a simple problem using ILOG Scheduler.
