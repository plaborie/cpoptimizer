*** REVIEW FORM ID: 295114::152747
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 146
*** TITLE: Problem Space Analysis for Library Generation and Algorithm Selection in Real-time Systems
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie

*** REVIEW:

The paper introduces the general notions of PS, SPU and SS maps
(Problem Space analysis) and illustrates them on a dynamic TSP problem
where n cities are known and one additional city to visit will be
known at run time only. It then shows how these notions can be used
(1) to build compacted libraries of efficient solutions and (2) to
guide the search at runtime when a new event occurs. The paper reviews
the main challenges of the approach concerning the size and the time spent
at generating the solution library and the speed-up it brings at
runtime and proposes some directions to tackle them.

To the best of my knowledge, the usage of the Problem Space Analysis
as proposed in the paper, and particulary to select and configure the
search algorithms is original. The work described in the paper still
is at an early stage but I think it sheds some interesting new lights
on real time problem solving. 

Some more detailed comments:

When sampling the problem space, several samples are solved. Are they
solved independently? I guess that if the new sample to solve is close
enough to another sample, one can exploit the effort spent at solving
the first one for speeding up the resolution of the new one (use the
first solution as starting point for the search which would give an
upper bound on the cost, etc.); this could speed up a lot the
construction of the sampled PS map. In fact this is quite similar to
what is done at runtime when an event occurs so one could think of
incrementally building the maps and making them more and more precise
by "simulating" the arrival of new events.

When sampling the problem space, I guess it would also make sense to
consider some probabilities on the events that can occur, typically
in order to oversample regions where the event has the most chances to
occur. 

In section "Interpolating solutions", it would be good to elaborate a
little bit on the simple classification scheme that shows promise.

Some sentences in the paper in sections Domain-informed sampling,
Results may be understood as if it was always the case that every
fixed city is at the border between at least two regions. This is
clearly not always the case as can be showed by a version of the
problem with only 2 fixed cities A,B for which the border between the
two regions is the bisector of the line segment AB. By the way, one
can probably show that the regions are connected surfaces, I wonder if
this can be exploited too.

I would anti-clockwise rotate figures 1 and 3 so that the orientation
is consistent with the one of figure 2 and 4.

The "competence" term in equation (1) is misleading as the most
"competent" solution has competence value 0. I would rather call it
competence loss in the equation.

Typo: in section "Sampling the Problem Space", "At the same time
... will not [be?] as precise".
