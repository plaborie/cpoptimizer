*** REVIEW FORM ID: 149689::90353
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 65
*** TITLE: Finding Sub-optimal Solutions for Problems of Path Planning for Multiple Robots in θ-like Environments
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie
--------------------------------------------------------------
*** REVIEW:

The paper describes an algorithm for solving a special case of
multi-robot path planning: the one on theta-like graphs and with only
one unoccupied vertex.

The work relies on a very interesting exploitation of some existing
theoretical results on the decomposition of permutations into
transpositions and/or 3-cycle rotations.

The paper is well written, especially the part about the theoretical
foundations and the one about the solving algorithm. The section about
the improved IDA* is less clear and would deserve, if possible, a
figure illustrating how the algorithm traverses the different
arrangements of robots.

The problem studied in the paper seems to be very specific: special
type of graph (theta-like) and only one unoccupied vertex. It is
mentioned both in the introduction and in the conclusion that (1) this
case is one of the most difficult case of the problem "in a certain
sense" and (2) solving the general problem can exploit the special
case algorithm described in the paper. But those two claims are not
supported in the paper and I think this is the main weakness of the
paper. Something should be said about the reason why this specific
case is so important.

The experimental comparison with the MIT algorithm is quite impressive
but it should be highlighted that the MIT algorithms works on an
arbitrary graph (an an arbitrary number of unoccupied places?) whereas
the proposed approach is dedicated to theta-graphs and 1 unoccupied
position. From the other side, one has the feeling that we probably
lose a lot in the sense of solution length when decomposing the
permutation into transpositions and 3-cycles. It would really be
interesting to have some good lower bounds on the length of the
optimal solution in order to quantify what is lost with the
decomposition.

Detailed comments:

p3, col1: it should be made clear that for G(2,3,2), only some
transpositions are feasible (if I get it well)

p3, col1: it would be good to have a reference for the statement that
when there is no cycle of odd length only arrangements corresponding
to even permutations are reachable.

p3, col1: after proposition 4: is O(|V^4|) the size of the sub-optimal
solution or the algorithmic complexity to build it, or both ?

p3,col1: I guess the size of the table for transpositions is O(n^2)
whereas the size of the table for 3-cycles is O(n^3) if n is the size
of the graph. The position of the unoccupied position does not enter
into consideration here, maybe it should be mentioned why.
