*** REVIEW FORM ID: 150184::90353
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 91
*** TITLE: SOHO Keyhole Periods Problem: Definition and a Solving Model
*** AUTHORS: (anonymous)
*** PC MEMBER: Philippe Laborie

*** REVIEW:

The paper describes the scheduling of SOHO data recording and
downlinking during keyhole periods. The proposed approach decomposes
the horizon into a set of time intervals with decision variables
corresponding to quantities of data recorded or downloaded for each
time interval. The problem is transformed into a layered max-flow
problem with one layer per time-interval and solved using classical
max-flow algorithms. As the decision variables may aggregate several
aspects (e.g. the recorded data on SSR may come from several
non-equivalent instruments), a special care is taken when building the
actual detailed schedule from the (aggregated) solution of the
max-flow problem. The method is currently under implementation.

At the first reading of the paper one may have the impression that the
duration of each interval t_j is a decision variable of the problem
(not a constant) and it makes it hard to understand how the max-flow
model can be decorrelated from the temporal dimension. I think it
should be clearly stated that the intervals t_j are
fixed. Furthermore, it should also be clearly stated that (as I
understand it) in the interval list, each communication interval is
followed by a no-communication interval and vice-versa. In this case,
it seems that a layer of the max-flow graph (as the one illustrated on
Figure 5) represents 2 time-intervals, the upper part represents a
no-communication time-interval t_j (where data is produced) and the
lower part represents the following time-interval t_{j+1} which is a
communication interval where data is dumped. The figure seems to
suggest that it is all about the same time-interval t_j.

It is not clear how the different data rates for instruments are
related with the importance or priority of the data collected by these
instruments as it seems to be suggested in section "Data production
and on-board storage". In this type of application one could expect
that the objective function (maximize amount of downloaded data) also
need to take into account the importance of the data itself which
probably depends (among other things) on the instrument that produced
it. I do not see how a physical constraint like the data rate of an
instrument can account for that and in this context, the way
activities are created for SSR recording activities from the solution
of the max-flow need more justification.

Detail comments:

p3, col2: Figure 3, when printed on a monochrome printer, it is hard
to distinguish the different colors, I would suggest to also use some
different patterns. On this figure, it would help to name the
different intervals: t_1,...,t_8 to better link it with the section on
model variables. It could also help to add on this figure, for each
interval, the related decision variables (d_ij, \delta_ij, etc)

p3, col2: Typo in paragraph on model variables: t-j => t_j

p4, col1: One deduces from constraints (1) and (2) that one cannot
have on the same interval data recording (d_ij>0) and data dumping
(\delta_ij>0) but it is not explicitly stated.
