Metareview (*):


The reviewers read author responses, discussed them and adjusted their comments and scores when needed.

While the approach introduces some interesting ideas, the reviewers agree that the paper falls short for acceptance at IJCAI on points like:
- Importance of the MWSC problem in practice
- No evaluation of the solution quality (for instance compared to exact approaches or lower bounds, even on simpler graphs)
- Lack of self-containedness of the paper
- Lack of algorithmic complexity analysis

Recommendation (*)
   accept
   (no recommendation)
*  reject


I just entered my meta-review on the paper and I'm planning to recommend the area chairs to reject the paper.
1) Please let me know if you do not agree with this recommendation and have some additional arguments for acceptance
2) Make sure that your final review reflects your opinion on the paper after the rebuttal stage and discussions with the other reviewers and revise your review if needed (in particular to acknowledge the authors answer)
