Metareview (*):

The reviewers read author responses, discussed them and adjusted their comments and scores when needed.

The paper provides some incremental improvements over the current best Local Search approach to solve the problem, in particular the "scored-based partition" structure. But it is still not clear if these improvements are very significant given that:
1- Most of the improvements seem to be due to the initial solution computation
2- The experimental section does not give any idea of the solution quality whereas it could be compared to some existing (not cited) work on exact approaches

I just entered my meta-review on the paper and I'm planning to recommend the area chairs to reject the paper.
1) Please let me know if you do not agree with this recommendation and have some additional arguments for acceptance
2) Make sure that your final review reflects your opinion on the paper after the rebuttal stage and discussions with the other reviewers and revise your review if needed (in particular to acknowledge the authors answer)
