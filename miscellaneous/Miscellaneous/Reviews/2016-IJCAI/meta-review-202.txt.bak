Metareview (*):


The reviewers read author responses, discussed them and adjusted their comments and scores when needed.

While the approach introduces some interesting ideas, the reviewers agree that the paper falls short for acceptance at IJCAI on points like:
- Importance of the MWSC problem in practice
- No evaluation of the solution quality (for instance compared to exact approaches or lower bounds, even on simpler graphs)
- Lack of self-containedness of the paper
- Lack of algorithmic complexity analysis
