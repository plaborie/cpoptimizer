Metareview (*):

The reviewers read author responses, discussed them and adjusted their comments and scores when needed.

The paper provides some incremental improvements over the current best Local Search approach to solve the problem, in particular the "scored-based partition" structure. But it is still not clear if these improvements are very significant given that:
1- Most of the improvements seem to be due to the initial solution computation
2- The experimental section does not give any idea of the solution quality whereas it could be compared to some existing (not cited) work on exact approaches
