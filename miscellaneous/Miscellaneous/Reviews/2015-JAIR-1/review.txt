I think this new version of the article satisfactorily addresses the issues I raised in my review. I particularly appreciate the proof that the problem is NP Complete even when taking into account the specificities of the costs of the subsets. A remark: in the current proof, the cost of the subsets Ej,t and Ej,t' are the same for t<t' whereas in the model, it is strictly decreasing with t due to function f, but I don't think it is a problem as in the reformulation of the weighted set cover problem, one can always use a sufficiently slowly decreasing function. Maybe the proof could be slightly improved by mentioning that.
