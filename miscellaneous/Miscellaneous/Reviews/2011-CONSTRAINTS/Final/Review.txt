Authors: Michele Lombardi and Michela Milano


Recommendation: Accept as is.

Reviewer Blind Comments to Author:

I think the article really has been improved, including its structure, some necessary clarifications and a careful selection of the references. I'm satisfied with all the answers provided to my comments on the initial version so I have not much to add.

This review will clearly be of interest for people interested in scheduling in the CP community. As another reviewer, I would suggest to also submit a version of the article to a more OR-oriented journal.
