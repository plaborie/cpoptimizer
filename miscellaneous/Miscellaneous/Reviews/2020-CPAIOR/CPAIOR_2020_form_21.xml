The paper is on the resolution of an original two-stage batching and scheduling problem that consists of the construction and the scheduling of a set of horizontal batches followed by vertical batches.

Several approaches are proposed, implemented and compared: a plain CP model, an LBBD decomposition, a simple heuristic and a combination of this heuristic with the first two approaches.

In general, the problem is very challenging and I think that the different approaches proposed in the paper really make sense.

I'm wondering if alternative formulations were considered for the CP model, as the number of introduced decision variables (interval variables) seems to be very large in the proposed formulation and with fairly week constraint propagation.

It is clear that there does not seem to be any straightforward formulation in CP but the concept of "state function" in CP Optimizer may be useful in this context. State functions were introduced for scheduling problems with a batching component, they allow the synchronization of the start and end times of interval variables representing jobs (or tools) scheduled in the same batch thanks to the notion of start/end alignment, without the need to explicitly create "batch" interval variables. There also exist some modeling techniques to explicitly represent the "batch" interval variables on top of a state-function based formulation, by creating one candidate "batch" optional interval variable for each job and post constraints to enforce that one and only one of these optional "batch" intervals are present for each batch. It would be interesting if this type of model could be useful for this two-stage batching and scheduling problem.
