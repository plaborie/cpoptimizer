The paper proposes a pre-processing step to solve a production scheduling problem with power saving states and time-varying energy prices.

The idea main idea is to precompute the optimal transitions (related with the power saving strategy) between two consecutive tasks. These optimal transitions can be computed as shortest paths in a graph.

The precomputed optimal transition costs are then injected in an ILP and a CP model that are both much simpler than the original models (who handle the transition computation).

It is not explicitely proved in the paper that the computation of the optimal transitions and the sequencing/scheduling of the tasks can be done independently without endangering the completness of the approach, but this result seems in fact quite evident.

An experimental study compares the two proposed models with precomputation (ILP and CP) against a reference model using a single ILP. The experimental study clearly shows the interest of the approach.

It seems that in this version of the problem it should be possible to exploit some symmetries between the tasks: two tasks with same processing time are equivalent (and this should be very common in the generated data as the processing times are selected in [1,5]) so they could be arbitrarily orerd (by a precedence constraint) in the input models. This could help both the ILP and the CP model.

In the proposed CP model, when breaking the symmetries on the variables x_l,k, do you also add precedence constraint between these variables (like endBeforeStart(x_{l,k}, x_{l,k+1})) ? It is not mentioned in the paper but it probably would help.

In the CP model, the interest to create optional intervals s_j,i for each job j and each time point i is not clear at all. Why not considering only the interval variables s_j and represent this part of the cost using expressions like startEval(F_{p_j},s_j) where F_{p_j} would be a step function describing the processing cost over time for a task of processing time p_j. This would remove a lot of decision variables of the problem and may result in better performance.

Still in the CP model, maybe you could also get rid of the (many!) interval variables x_l,k by getting the gap between two consecutive tasks s_j and its immediate successor (something like gap_j = startOfNext(seq,s_j)-endOf(s_j)) and express the optimal transition as a function of both endOf(s_j) and gap_j. But here, indeed, you would need some element expression with a double indexing. But at least, the number of decision variables of the model would be kept very small (basically, the number of tasks). I'm wondering if you tried this type of model.
