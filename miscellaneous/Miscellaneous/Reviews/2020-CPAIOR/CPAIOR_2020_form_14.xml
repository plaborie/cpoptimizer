It is not clear how the topic of the extended abstract fits the scope of the CP-AI-OR conference.

The paper is about a very specific stochastic scheduling problem (two machines no-wait flowshop with stochastic
setup times and maximum lateness minimization).

A resolution algorithm is proposed but it is not mentioned whether this algorithm uses some CP or
OR techniques (in fact the abstract does not describe this algorithm at all). It is also not mentioned
whether the algorithm is exact or not.

The paragraph about the experiments should also give more information about the reference approach the proposed algorithms are compared to.
And also give an idea of the problem size otherwise a statement like "The average computational time of the newly proposed algorithm is less than a second" is not very informative.

This type of paper seems better suited for a scheduling OR-oriented conference like MISTA for example.
