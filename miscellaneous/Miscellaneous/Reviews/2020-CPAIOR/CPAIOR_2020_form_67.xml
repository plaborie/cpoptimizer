The paper describes a scheduling problem in the context of the textile industry that involves cumulative and disjunctive resources with setup activities. Several approaches are proposed : a greedy heuristic, a heuristic based on optimal resolution of the TSP component of the problem and a CP model. Those approaches are also combined with a simple LNS approach.

It is difficult to have an idea of the absolute quality of the best solutions found (by CP) compared to an optimal solution. As suggested by the difference between the heuristics (Circuit and Greedy) and the CP approach (something like one order of magnitude for the objective value), the nature of the objective (a weighted sum of tardiness) whose optimal value could be 0 makes it hard to assess the real quality of the best solutions found. It would be interesting to compare these objective value to optimal solutions, or at least some lower bounds, probably only on small variants of the problem.

The proposed LNS approach is based on unfreezing some looms in the schedule. The description suggest that the unselected looms are left completely fixed in the schedule (start and end value). This type of strategy may leave few opportunities to reschedule the unfrozen looms in between the fixed ones. And more flexible strategies were developed (for example the one used in the automatic search of CP Optimizer) to work with Partial Order Schedules (POS) instead of fixed schedules for the frozen part.

Some statements in the abstract or the introduction are too general. It is not true that in general "the size of the scheduling instances that can be solved remain small compared to what the industry needs. As a comparison, it is common to observe industrial instances with 600 tasks and one hundred resources while the largest instances in the benchmark PSPLIB have only 120 tasks and 4 resources.". The size of the existing academical benchmark (indeed often limited to very small size) do not reflect the state-of-the-art of scheduling with CP technology in the industry. See for instance [1] on jobshop problems up to 1.000.000 tasks or [2] for RCPSP with up to 500.000 tasks.

A particular type of scheduling problem is described in subsection 2.1 (basically, an RCPSP plus some disjunctive resources with sequence-dependent setup times), but it seems that the problem studied in the paper is not a particular case of this "general" problem. Indeed, the problem described in 2.1 only consider setup-times but do not consider the more complex case of setup-activities that have sequence dependent duration AND require some resources. So in this context, I not really sure susection 2.1 is really useful. Furthermore, in the context of CP-AI-OR, I think most of the readers/audience know about Local Search and LNS so subsections 2.2 and 2.3 could be also simplified.

While the description of the problem is pretty clear, a picture for an illustration of the different activities in the schedule (tasks, major and minor setups) could be useful in section 3.
