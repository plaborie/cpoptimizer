The paper studies a bilevel scheduling problem. Bilevel optimization
is an important topic in mathematical programming but, to the best of
my knowledge, its application to scheduling problems has not received
a lot of attention so far. From this perspective, the paper is
original and, because this scheduling problem is solved using
constraint programming techniques, it is very relevant to the
workshop.

The bilevel scheduling problem that is described as a sample problem
seems very unrealistic. Does it comes from a real use-case? It is
clear that organizational relations within a company can lead to
different constraints and objective functions among different
departments but it is strange that deadline constraints are not taken
into account at all (at least as tardiness costs) in the scheduling
problem of the follower. I guess a consequence can be that, when the
deadlines are a bit tight (as they often are!), most of the good
solutions of the leader are ruled out by the follower. It would be
interesting to add figures in the experimental section showing, for
each class of instance what is the average optimal solution value for
the single level relaxation compared with the average optimal solution
value for the bilevel problem.

The paper is well structured but sometimes, some additional
explanations would be useful. In particular, it is not clear at first
sight why, when comparing the follower's lower and upper bound we can
have g^{Fmax}<g^{Lmin} given their definition. I think a paragraph
should be dedicated to informally explain why it can happen.

The LB computation in internal search nodes seems very time consuming
with its pseudo-polynomial complexity in O(VP). It is not really
surprising that it does not help solving the problem in terms of CPU
time. If some space must be saved in the paper (for instance for
better justifying the interest of the sample problem or for explaining
why we can have g^{Fmax}<g^{Lmin}), I would suggest to remove this
subsection.



Any specific points that must be addressed before the paper is accepted:

The first sentence of section "Modeling and solving bilevel problems
by CP" reads: "... we first present a generic approach to encode
discrete bilevel optimization problems as constraint programs". This
is misleading because the last sentence of previous section says that
no trivial encoding of bilevel problems into CP can be expected (which
is true). In the previous section I would rather say that no "direct
encoding" into CP can be expected and, in the section I would avoid
the term "encoding" which implies just a simple "model&run" approach
and say somehting like: "we present a generic approach to solve
bilevel optimization problems using CP techniques".

A typo:
p2, col2: "we present analyze ..."
