                  Preferences in AI and CP

      [Submission Dead-line of March 1, 2003 is approaching]
          

Preferences are gaining more and more attention in Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Constraint Programming (CP). As described in 
the article of Jon Doyle and Richmond Thomason about qualitative 
decision theory (AI Magazine, 1999), AI provides qualitative methods 
for treating preferences that can improve or complement numerical 
methods for treating preferences from classical decision theory. 
Preferences prove essential in treating conflicting information in 
nonmonotonic reasoning, reasoning about action and time, planning, 
diagnosis, configuration, and other areas of knowledge representation 
and reasoning. Constraint programming uses preferences to treat soft 
constraints, to reduce search effort, and to deal with multiple 
optimization criteria.

Preferences complement constraints and represent an AI counterpart 
to objective or utility functions. Preferences allow one to treat 
conflicting information and to choose among alternatives, such as 
most-specific default rules in a taxonomy, preferred user choices 
in web-based configuration, and preferred start dates for scheduling 
activities. In contrast to hard constraints, preferences do not 
eliminate the non-selected alternatives, which may become interesting 
if additional information is added. AI permits complex preference 
representations and thus allows systems to reason with and about 
preferences. AI thus provides a new perspective for formalizing 
information that is essential for many decision making problems, 
including web-based configuration, scheduling, and robot planners.

Although several approaches for treating preferences have been 
developed in AI, the mathematical formulations as well as the 
applications of the preferences are often quite different. A dedicated 
workshop on symbolic preference handling methods at AAAI-02 in Edmonton 

    http://www.cs.sfu.ca/Conf/prefs02/

allowed researchers from different sub-fields of AI to discuss 
questions of common interest and to get an overview on different 
symbolic and qualitative methods for treating preferences. Based on 
the success of this workshop, we decided to edit a special issue of 
the Journal of Computational Intelligence on preferences. In addition 
to submissions based on workshop presentations, we would also like to 
invite submissions of papers that were not presented at the workshop.

Computational intelligence is a leading international journal promoting
and stimulating research in the field of AI. Covering a wide range of 
issues - from the tools and languages of AI to its philosophical 
implications - Computational Intelligence provides a vigorous forum 
for the publication of both experimental and theoretical research, as 
well as surveys and impact studies. Please consult the journal web 
page for more information:

AREAS OF INTEREST

The purpose of the special issue is to provide an overview about new 
methods for dealing with preferences in AI and CP. We have identified 
the following, non-exhaustive list of interesting subareas for the 
publication:

 - preferences in qualitative decision theory
 - preferences in non-monotonic reasoning
 - preferences in logic programming
 - preferences for soft constraints
 - preferences for search and optimization
 - preferences for AI planning
 - preferences reasoning about action and causality
 - preference logic
 - preference representations (e.g., graphical models)
 - acquisition and learning of preferences
 - preference elicitation
 - revision of preferences
 - comparison of approaches
 - applications of preferences.

For the special issue, we expect original research papers of high 
quality providing theoretical and/or computational results about 
preference handling methods or showing the application of such 
methods to real-world problems.

REVIEWING

The submitted papers will be peer-reviewed according to standard 
reviewing criteria for international journals such as relevance, 
originality, technical quality, and clarity of presentation. Since 
the special issue will regroup quite different preference handling 
approaches, papers should not only focus on technical results, but 
also give some general motivations of the considered approach and 
some description of the kind of preferences that can be treated.

SUBMISSIONS

We prefer to receive the contributions in electronic form in a 
platform-independent format such as postscript or pdf. However, 
other submission formats will also be accepted. Please email your 
submissions to following address:

    ujunker@ilog.fr

The deadline for submission is March 1, 2003.

Guidelines for submissions can be found at:
