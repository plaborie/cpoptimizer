----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper describes a greedy approach based on bin packing to solve the allocation of communication requests to base station(s). The paper suffers a lot from bad clarity. There is a lot of telecommunication jargon but the problem solved is not clear. Honestly, from the text I do not know what problem is being solved. It is not clear whether there are more stations to which the requests are allocated (the algorithm is proposed for one station, while Figure 1 shows more stations), whether the ratio between bandwidth and time is selected by the algorithm or given in the input, whether this is on-line or off-line problem etc. 

I strongly suggest the authors to describe the problem formally at some abstract level, the specification in Section 2 is not satisfactory to understand the problem from the algorithmic point of view.

The method itself seems straightforward; the algorithm takes the requests in a given order and allocates them using a given heuristic. There is no exploration of alternative solutions. Despite a long section on related works, there is no comparison to any of them at the experimental section that only shows the behavior of the algorithm at specific situations.

In summary, this might be an interesting application of known techniques from bin packing to allocating telecommunication requests, but the paper must be significantly revised to define clearly the problem, describe precisely the solving method, and compare it with existing techniques.

Answer> Clarified that there is just one hub, but multiple terminals (the other small stations in figure 1). The ratio between bandwidth and time of the possible transmissions (3 types of bursts) is given as an input and is a result of the communication system physical layer design (modulation and coding). The problem is both, on-line and off-line, because requests arrive as in an on-line problem, but are packed periodically (off-line), not as they arrive, as it would be in the case of being a pure on-line algorithm.
Description of problem formally at some abstract level performed at section 2, which has been extended.
The only alternative solution explored is the bottom-left packing approach.

Some particular comments:

Page 1, row 5: I am a bit surprised that users would want to send information with a minimum reliability. I think that maximum reliability is preferred. Perhaps you mean that the user requests some minimum reliability.
Answer> Yes, it is. Changed to "given reliability", because the resource gives what it gives, not necessarily what the user would like to have.

Page 2, para 2, row 3: The same problem � do we really want to have maximum packet-loss rate?
Answer> Clarified that it is a maximum tolerated packet-loss rate, it is, we want the packet loss rate to be always lower than this one specified by the user.

Page 2, Figure 1: It is not clear what the figure is supposed to say. Are there more stations that we should schedule or just one?
Answer> The figure shows the satellite communication network considered in the paper, with just one hub (the building with an antenna in the rooftop), on the right, assigning transmission resources to the remote terminals (three antennas on the left), linked via satellite. In the forward link, from the hub to the terminals, just the hub is transmitting and the remote terminals are all receiving, while in the return link, just the hub is receiving and the remote terminals must be coordinated by the hub, so they do not interfere by sending simultaneously on the same time and frequency. Explanation added.

Page 3: It seems that the problem is on-line as new requests are coming, but the proposed algorithm is clearly off-line. Please define the problem clearly � what is the input and what is the output?
Answer> The input of the algorithm is the Capacity Requests profile, i.e. a file describing on each line a CR, which is characterized by: arrival time, expiration time, burst type (bandwidth, one of the three considered) and overall duration (multiple of T). The output of the algorithm is a set of burst time plans (BTP), that describes the assignment of the CR using the minimum possible bandwidth and respecting the system constraints: single transmitter per terminal and minimization of terminals frequency hoping to reduce BTP sizes (signalling amount).

You are talking about some limit parameter, what do you mean? What is it limiting? How this limit is obtained?
Answer> Clarified the explanation of the obliged transmission threshold parameter and which limit it imposes and which trade-off it implies.

�the goal of the problem� sounds strange, you probably mean �the task to solve� or �the problem to solve� etc.
Answer> Changed to "the problem to solve"

Page 4, row 3-: Is the goal really to maximize the number of used resources? Or do you mean that we prefer higher bandwidth to longer duration for each request?
Answer> page 4, row 3 is not talking about maximizing the number of used resources, not understood. The requests are an input. They have two dimensions, time and frequency. The only dimension with which we can play is the expiration time. We can schedule a CR sooner or later within the expiration time, considering its duration and required bandwidth to allocate them on a given BTP. In our problem we are considering the monthly rental of a given satellite bandwidth, so time is let's say unlimited (24x7) and the cost just depends on the contracted bandwidth, so this is what we want to minimize. Added clarification.

Page 6: How do you obtain the value of T_SF?
Answer> Formula added.

Page 7: How do you split the set of requests into floor and floating? What criteria are used there?
Answer> The mentioned constraint of having one transmitter per terminal is what determines whether a transmission is floor or floating. A transmission is floor if does not have any preceding transmission on a given terminal with the same bandwidth, otherwise it is floating. Literally explained in the article first version submitted for revision here: "The floor bursts vector contains the first transmissions of each terminal on current SF, while the floating bursts vector contains subsequent ones, but which bandwidth is different than previous transmissions." The chance of alignment of the assignment periods with the CR arrival is what determines if a burst assignment is floor or floating, it is something you find, not determine. Added clarification sentence: "Note that the fact a burst is floor or floating is determined by the chance of the alignment of the CR arrivals with the period of assignments."

----------- REVIEW -----------
The authors propose an adaptation of a heuristic for a 2D strip packing problem to a bandwidth minimization problem arising in satellite telecommunication networks. The adaptation is done by considering few additional restrictions imposed by the problem but also simplifications in the implementation. 

Overall, my impression is that the paper is on early stages of the development of the algorithm. For a more complete paper, I would have liked to see more analysis on what is, for example, the impact of the algorithm simplifications on performance in terms of the solution quality that is reached but also on computation time. From the description it is difficult to grasp what impact these simplifications have.

Answer> The impact of simplifications has not been evaluated. It could be a possible option for a future research.

The experimental evaluation is also missing some comparison to other algorithms or lower bounds to rate how well the algorithm is performing. As a result, from the way the comparison is done it is difficult to grasp whether the algorithms are actually well performing.

Answer> The experimental evaluation is comparing the algorithm with an almost "do nothing" approach (bottom-left packing), as a lower bounds is not available. It is left for future research the evaluation of other approaches that could produce lower bounds (e.g. exhaustive search), but according to the quality of the solutions obtained in terms of use of available resources (packing efficiency), there is not so much margin left for improvement, which indicates that probably the problem was not so hard as it looked.

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to solve a resource allocation problem on satellite networks. The algorithm is based on the best fit decreasing heuristic for two-dimensional packing. The authors claim that the problem has not been previously studied with optimization techniques and therefore their approach is original. Preliminary experimental results are provided.

The paper is definitely of interest to the workshop. It describes a real-life, challenging optimization problem and shows how it can be tackled. I therefore recommend its acceptance. Having said that, the paper is not mature in a number of ways. In the following I provide some suggestions that the authors should take into account for the journal submission. 

The tackled problem is complex and unfortunately is not described clearly. To give some examples: 
 - The problem context includes many new terminology that can be difficult to grasp for someone who is not knowledgeable in the area. There are some notions and  their abbreviations (like those referring to standards or protocols) which are not used later or not very significant for understanding the problem. A more refined context description is needed.

Answer> Formal problem description added in section 2 of the extended version.

 -  Figures are not explained well. For instance Figure 2 is never explained.

Answer> Figure was explained, but referring to figure 3. Corrected.

Abbreviations like BW and RF are not defined. 

Answer> Added mentioned abbreviation explanations. BW - bandwidth, RF - radio frequency

At the end of the first paragraph of Section 2, Figure 3 is referred to, as opposed to Figure 2�

Answer> Editorial error. Corrected as per answer to comment about Figure 2 never explained.

The complexity of the proposed algorithm has not been studied in detail, but considering that the original BFDH heuristic has O(n) complexity, due to a for loop (see Ntene 2007 reference, section 2.1.1.3), our algorithm, which performs BFDH twice, once for obliged transmissions and other for optional transmissions, would have O(n^2) complexity in the worst case.

Answer> Agreed, it has not been studied.

While the Workshop focuses on experimental analysis of algorithms, the paper provides limited experiments and analysis of results. A thorough experimentation, clear explanation of the experimental set up and deeper study of results are needed. Also, some sort of comparison to a general purpose optimization method is important to judge the significance of the algorithm.

Answer> Partially addressed in the extended version.

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper tackles a communication resource allocation problem for satellite networks. The authors consider a specific protocol where communication requests are dispatched to a single hub on a dedicated channel. Each request refers to set of bursts of data to be transferred. Data transfers are periodically scheduled by the hub, based on the pending requests. Each burst has a known bandwidth requirement and must be performed within a specific time limit. The author solve the problem via an adaptation of a well-known strip-packing heuristic. In this context, the scheduler period plays the role of the strip width and the bandwidth represents the strip length. The paper reports some computational results.

This work provides a nice contribution by applying an existing technique from the OR field to an unconventional and interesting problem. The proposed technique is indeed very simple, which is actually an advantage, given that the nature of the problem calls for real-time solution approaches.

The paper has in my opinion two main weaknesses:
1) It lacks precision and formality: this holds for the problem description, the algorithm discussion and the presentation of the results. I suggest to:
- Use symbols to denote the problem entities and their attributes (e.g. requests, bandwidth, communication resources...).
- Provide a formal problem model.
Answer> Formal problem model added in section 2.

- Discuss the algorithm step by step. This is currently done in a little detailed fashion only in the last paragraph from Section 4.
Answer> Pseudo-code provided, the main algorithm steps are discussed. Source code available on-line.

- Provide precise details on the generated instances.
Answer> Which precise details should be provided?

2) There is no comparison with the existing approaches. This is particularly strange, since the related work section is extensive and well done. I understand that the authors may be tackling a particular problem variant, for which readily available results do not exist. However, a comparison is definitely needed to assess the value of the proposed heuristic, especially given its simplicity. Even comparing the approach with the simplest-to�adapt method from Section 3 would be enough.
Answer> There is a comparison with an almost "do nothing" approach: bottom-left packing.

A list of typos and minor comments follows:
- pg 3, "it is located...": unclear. The authors should also say something about how the timeout is decided (I guess it is part of the problem input, right?)-
Answer> changes to it is placed and added explanation about time out computation
- pg 3, "It could happen that...": very unclear.
Answer> changed to "it can happen that". Explanation of overlapp of CR as cause of negative timeouts.
- pg 3, "A limit parameter": too vague.
Answer> Already changed as per 1st reviewer comment.
- pg 3, "Despite this, for a give traffic profile...": unclear.
Answer> changed to "despite this trade-off, for a given traffic profile"
- pg 4: the data expiration time has never been introduced before.
Answer> Introduced earlier when "expiration time" is mentioned
- pg 4: "constraints" --> constrains
Answer> Done find & replace
- pg 4, "after allocation of bursts...": both incorrect and unclear.
Answer> Changed to after performing the allocation of CR.
- In general, the work contains a lot of acronyms, with make it difficult to read by anyone not familiar with satellite protocols.
Answer> The acronyms are always explained. Anybody interested can check the definition of the terms that compose the acronym. Section 2 has been extended to explain some of them.
- pg 5, "results of the Game Theory" --> from Game Theory.
Answer> Changed.
- pg 6, "to solve each T_{SF}": rephrase more precisely.
Answer> added "assignment period"
- pg 6, "the packing is done up in the frequency dimension": vague and unclear.
Answer> Changed to "The packing heuristic levels are piled up in the frequency dimension"
- pg 7, "and following levels" --> reformulate.
Answer> changed to "upper levels" and revised.
- pg 7, "For the next level...": unclear.
Answer> Changed to "On a given level". Same as before, to be revised by Sergio also.
- pg 7, "Our proposed packing algorithm, starts": remove the comma.
Answer> comma removed
- pg 7: floor and floating bursts have never been defined.
Answer> Definition added as per 1st reviewer comments
- pg 7, "Each T_{SF} the is a first stage": very unclear. Moreover: what is the rationale for treating floor and floating bursts in separate phases?
Answer> Changed to "Each assignment period". The floor an floating bursts vectors are treated jointly. It is never said they are treated in separate phases.
- pg 7, "contains subsequent ones, but which bandwidth...": unclear.
Answer> Changed as per 1st reviewer comments.
- pg 7, "In case the initial simple packing exceeds...": unclear.
Answer> already clarified as per 1st reviewer comments
- pg 7, "to simplify the implementation is that" --> implementation, is that
Answer> Comma position corrected
- pg 8, "then the maximum used up to now or not": unclear. There is a continuous switching between "minimum" and "maximum" in this paragraph, which makes it a bit confusing.
Answer> Added clarification at the end of the paragraph.
- pg 8: to "create a solution" is not a well defined expression in an algorithmic context. Say something like "prepare a data structure to hold the solution information".
Answer> Expression already removed as per 1st reviewer comments
- pg 8, "assess" --> "evaluate" (or "assess the effectiveness").
Answer> assess replaced by evaluate
- pg 9: I suggest to use vector graphics or (even better) the algorithmic LaTeX package for the pseudo code. Currently, it appears to be done in raster graphics, which tend to be blurry when printed.
Answer> Supposed it is referring to Figure 4. Looks nice in the PDF. Paper edited with Office 2007.
- pg 9: what do the authors mean by "bootstrapping techniques"?
Answer> Reference to this kind of techniques inserted in this section.
- pg 9, "assumed to be representative": reformulate.
Answer> Rephrased: "The reported levels of $\lambda$ (Packet Loss Rate) are considered acceptable for ATM data applications."
- pg 10, "This means that a message can be transmitted as soon as it is received": it would be better to tell also what this means in for the proposed algorithm.
Answer> Added what this means in for the proposed algorithm.
- pg 11: simulation-optimization techniques have ever been mentioned before.
Answer> Changed "simulation-optimization" by "strip packing"
- pg 12: the meaning of "structured" and "unstructured" approach has not been sufficiently clarified before.
Answer> Added clarifications when considered convenient as per 1st reviewer comments.
