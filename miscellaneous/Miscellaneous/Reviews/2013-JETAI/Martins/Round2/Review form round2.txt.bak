Detailed comments to authors:





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the paper, you received its first-round reviews as
well as a letter from the authors explaining how they have dealt with these 
reviews in the resubmitted version of their paper.

Did authors properly took into account the comments expressed by the first-round reviewers _other_ than you? 
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, completely (either by improving the paper or by giving convincing evidence 
  in the accompanying letter that addressing such comments would be out of the scope 
  of the paper or could/should not be done).

- There are still some important points that have not been addressed, 
  neither in the paper nor in the accompanying letter.

- No.


If you are not fully satisfied about how authors addressed comments by the other 
first-round reviewers, please explain why:

Overall judgement
(Please, delete all categories except one)

1 - Reject
The paper is not yet mature, or of not sufficient quality for publication in a major journal 
as JETAI. After having read the first-round reviews, the new version of the paper and the accompanying letter,
my opinion is that still too much work needs to be done by the authors in order to make
this submission publishable. 
Unfortunately, the time constraints of this special issue do not allow a further revision stage, hence
I vote for a reject.

2 - Resubmit for a last quick review (please choose this option only in exceptional circumstances)
This is a good paper, of the same or of better quality wrt. the usual quality of articles
published in the major journals in the area. 
However, there are still some minor issues that should be solved and double-checked before publication.
As an exceptional circumstance, I allow authors to resubmit in short time a new version of the paper 
on which I will express my final opinion.

3 - Accept
This is a good paper, of the same or of better quality wrt. the usual quality of articles
published in the major journals in the area. 
There are at most very minor issues that should be solved before publication, but they are absolutely not
critical and very easy to solve. 
I'm not in need to review this paper again.
