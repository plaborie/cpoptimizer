Detailed comments to authors:

I have no special comments in fact. The authors really made an important effort to extend the approaches presented in the original RCRA paper (with the hybrid approach) and improve the experimental evaluation (larger benchmark, comparison with more state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers). The extensions are clear, well described and significant. All points in the article are well justified. I particularly appreciate the illustration of the different algorithms with the ongoing example. I think this will be a very interesting article for the MaxSAT community.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the paper, you received its workshop reviews as
well as a letter from the authors explaining how they have dealt with these 
reviews in the current version.

Did authors properly took into account the comments of the workshop reviewers (other than you)? 
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, completely (either by improving the paper or by giving convincing evidence 
  in the accompanying letter that addressing such comments would be out of the scope 
  of the paper or could/should not be done).

As a former reviewer of the workshop version of this paper, 
are you satisfied with how authors took into account your own comments?
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, I'm fully satisfied

3 - Accept subject to minor revision 
This is a good paper, of the same or of better quality wrt. the usual quality of articles
published in the major journals in the area. 
There are only minor issues that should be solved before publication, but they do not seem 
critical and appear easy to solve. Although I will take a final decision only after having quickly 
reviewed the new version of the paper, I'm reasonably confident that there will be no bad surprises.
