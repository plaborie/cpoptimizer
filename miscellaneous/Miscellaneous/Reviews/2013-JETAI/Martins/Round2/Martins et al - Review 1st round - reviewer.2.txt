Title: Improving Linear Search Algorithms with Model-based Approaches for MaxSAT Solving
Authors: Ruben Martins, Vasco Manquinho, Ines Lynce


CONTENT
Please, answer Yes or No.

Is the paper technically sound?
Yes, mostly, but some formal details need to be fixed.

Is the work described original?
Yes, although quite incremental and not very deep.

Does it place new results in appropriate context with earlier work?
No, in terms of the empirical evaluation. 
Also, the connections to related work should be 
more clearly discussed already in the introduction section. 
Yes, apart for these.

Does anything need to be added or deleted?
Yes, as detailed below.

Is the result important enough to warrant publication?
Yes, although due to the incremental nature of the work 
I would be more sceptical if this would have been
submitted to a more high-quality journal.
Further analysis should be provided for justifying some of 
the strong claims made.

FORM
Please, answer Yes or No.

Does the abstract adequately reflect the contents?
Yes, apart from the fact that I am not 100% convinced about the 
claim on "improving the current state-of-the-art in MaxSAT solving".

Are the summary and conclusions adequate?
Yes, apart from the similar claim as in the abstract.

Does it contain adequate references to previous work?
Yes, mostly.

Does it explain clearly what was done that is new?
Yes, mostly.

Does it clearly indicate why this work is important?
Yes, to the extent possible, due to the incremental nature of the work.

Is the English satisfactory?
Yes, although some proof reading is necessary.

Is the presentation otherwise satisfactory?
No, especially the more formal parts need to be revised (esp. related to
the proofs of correctness.)

Are there an appropriate number of figures?
Do the figures help clarify the concepts in the paper?
Yes, yes.

Detailed comments to authors:

I recomment accepting the manuscript for publication subject to 
a major revision, taking into account all of the following comments.

The most critical issue needing revision:

I am not 100% convinced about the claim that the (best-performing variant of)
the algorithms proposed improves on the state-of-the-art in MaxSAT solving.
This is due to two things:

(1) Austin appears to improve the best current MaxSAT solvers (esp. MSU-BIN-C-D)
only on a *single* problem domain, namely, "close solutions". 
The authors should provide arguments why this is especially interesting,
or better, include more problem domain and provide more fine-grained views
to the results on the individual MaxSAT Evaluation problem domains.
A more "standard" way would be to evaluate the algorithms only on the MaxSAT Evaluation
instances, in which case Austin would not improve over the state of the art.
The more benchmarks, the better, of course, but the benchmark selection should
be somewhat balanced: Now there is a clear imbalance in the benchmark selection 
in view of Figure 3, since the number of problem instances from the "close solutions" domain 
is high compared to the *total* number of miscellaneous MaxSAT Evaluation instances.
Hence the claim "The results are clear: Austin outperforms all other MaxSAT solvers ..."
is quite misleading.
Is "close solutions" more interesting as a problem domain than the
individual problem domains constituting the MaxSAT Evaluation instance sets?
How does Austin compare to the other solvers on the individual problem domains? 
Is MaxSAT the best approach to solving "close solutions"?
How is the problem encoded in MaxSAT?
What are the underlying SAT instances from which the "close solutions" MaxSAT
instances have been based on, and how was the "first solution" obtained?

(2) The evaluation is critically missing the recently proposed MaxSAT solver
MaxHS, http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jdavies/daviesCP13.pdf
(and earlier papers at SAT'13, CP'11). This is based on a different type of a
hybrid algorithm, and I look forward to seeing how it performs in comparison
on each of the benchmark sets. This evaluation needs to be added.


More detailed comments in chronological order:

Section 1:

-"A preliminary version of this work was published ... . In previous work".
Please revise these sentences. It is unclear to me to what "In previous work"
refers to. Was the RCRA paper formally published somewhere?

-The introduction should be extended with a thorough discussion on "previous work"
with references, so as to make the sentence "This paper extends previous work ..."
more explicit.

Section 2:

-"... as being a multiset of clauses". This is a strange sentence.
My guess is that you are trying to say that (integer) weighted MaxSAT can be viewed
like this by dublicating clauses according to the weights?

-Instead of \varphi = \varphi_h \cup \varphi_s, why not view \varphi as a pair
(\varphi_h,\varphi_s) ?

-Definitions 2.1-2.3 are repeating to an extent what was already defined.
Please compact.

-"An optimal solution ... would be". 
would be -> is.

-"unsatisfied" is not defined. Should be "not satisfied". (repeatedly in the paper)

-\sum_i=1^k x_i. Replace x_i with l_i, and explicate that *l_i* is a literal.

-"Although cardinality constraints do not occur in MaxSAT
formulations" is a strange sentence. Definitely there are underlying cardinality constraints
is various problem that have been encoded as MaxSAT. Please revise.

Section 2.1:

-include MaxHS as a reference.

-"Since this paper focus*es* on".
Please provide justifications for *why* this is the focus. Are they competitive?

-"linear search *over*" (not "on")

-"Algorithm 1 shows"  -> "...is presented as Algorithm 1".

-"problem variables" not defined.

-"no satisfiable call" revise. This base case should be explain
as one of the first things.

-Example 2.5 (and the later examples): the sentence flip back of forth
between the active "we" and the passive. Please revise by removing "we".
It is the algorithm, not we.

Section 3:

-"in contrast *to*"

2nd sentence:
"In contrast with traditional linear search algorithms, model-based
algorithms use models given by the SAT solver to iteratively increase the set of relaxation
variables that are used in the cardinality constraint."
One sentence after that:
"The first algorithm uses the models given by the SAT solver to iteratively
increase the set of relaxation variables that are used in the cardinality constraint."
Please revise. Right now it looks like the first algorithm is exactly
what "model-based algorithms" are as you define them.

-"a partial partition *of*"

-Section 3.1. title "Model-based Algorithms" is repetitive.

-"Even t*h*ough"

-"Algorithm 2 shows our adaptation" what did you adapt, and how?

-For Defs 3.1-3.2, I suggest defining a "stage" of the algorithm, 
and the referring to "at any stage", so that the definitions are more
explicitly tied with the execution.
"the algorithm" should be "Algorithm 1".
"did not found" -> at this stage the SAT solver calls have not produced
a model that assigns r to 1?
"did not found" would be "did not find" or better "has not yet returned".

-"Alg 2 may require additional SAT calls" how many in the worst case?
What happens in practice?

-"Proof sketch" is not ok for a full-length journal article. please revise.

-"As a result, we have  ..." the following set definition seems to be 
"the wrong way", what is after ":" should be before, and vice versa?

-Lemma 3.4: should be "\varphi_R is satisfiable iff \varphi_h is satisfiable".

-"can easily define" remove "easily".

-Lemma 3.5: "The converse" is too implicit and informal. Please be more specific.
split the lemma into two parts.

-"is minimum" over what? please revise.

-Lemma 3.6: here you will also benefit from defining a "stage" of the algorithm.
However, you want to say that after a rel. variable becomes active, it never 
becomes inactive (will remain active).

-Lemma 3.6. should be explicitly connected to Alg 2.

-Lemma 3.7: "the algorithm" -> Algorithm 2.

-Thm 3.8: remove "model-based".
"*the* correct solution" is incorrect. Should be *a*.

Section 3.2:

-"latter use" -> later use.

-Algorithm 3, line 22: \cap should be \wedge?
Same problem in alg 4, line 25.

-"the these" remove "the.

-Lemma 3.13: "improved on" not defined?

-Lemma 3.15: "Otherwise, ... " sentence appears redundant here?
In any case, revise.

-Thm 3.17: remove "model-based".

Section 3.3:

-"active ." remove space (two occurrences)

-"we are reducing" is too definitive. Please revise.
Also, should be "we reduce".

-"truth value 1," remove ",".

-Theorem on the correctness of Algorithm 4 is missing, and must be provided.

Section 4:

-Def 4.1 is extremely vague, and not really a definition at all.
"the dependencies between assignments" should be revised.
Either crisply define what you want to define, or use the somewhat standard 
terminology along with appropriate references and pointers.

-The paragraph on (non-)incremental SAT solving is vague and badly worded.
Please revise.
"is denoted by" should revised to "we call" or similar. (other occurrences too)
You should explicate that the underlying idea is to keep learned clauses
and *still maintain correctness*. 

Section 5: 

-"in a selection" please revise for more clarity.

-How robust/dependent is Austin wrt the choice of the SAT solver and cardinality 
encoding? Please add explicit data or at least discussion.
Why did you make these choices, and based on what?

-Please include explicit details on the close solution (see the main comments above for more).

-"the problem that was observed" what does this refer to? please revise.

-Section 5.4, solver listing:
The various solvers used both different SAT solvers and different cardinality constraints.
Has the effects of these choices been evaluated somewhere?
Please provide appropriate references.
Also, include explicit discussion pointing out these differences.
Based on the relatively small differences in the performance of the solvers,
I would like to know how large part of the differences is due to 
the choice of the SAT solver/encoding.

-"the most robust solver this outperforming" I don't see this causal relation.
Please revise. As already mentioned, as far as I can see, Austin is better than
MSU-BIN-C-D only in a single problem domain.

-"The results are clear". Not really. Please revise.

Section 6:

-"Linear search algorithms for MaxSAT have shown to be particularly effective when the
number of soft clauses is small. However, if the number of soft clauses increases, then
the performance of linear search algorithms tends to deteriorate."
I would have liked to have seen more detailed experimental data supporting this claim.
Can you show (based on the actual data that you already have)
an actual correlation between the number of soft clauses and
the performance, as a plot?

-"outperforms state-of-the-art". This should be toned down, and revised to better reflect
the results, including a comparison with MaxHS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the paper, you received its workshop reviews as
well as a letter from the authors explaining how they have dealt with these 
reviews in the current version.

Did authors properly took into account the comments of the workshop reviewers (other than you)? 
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, completely (either by improving the paper or by giving convincing evidence 
  in the accompanying letter that addressing such comments would be out of the scope 
  of the paper or could/should not be done).


Overall judgement
(Please, delete all categories except one)

2 - Resubmit after major revision
The paper is not yet mature, or of not sufficient quality for publication in a journal 
as JETAI. There are critical issues that must be solved. 
I ask for resubmission and another review.
