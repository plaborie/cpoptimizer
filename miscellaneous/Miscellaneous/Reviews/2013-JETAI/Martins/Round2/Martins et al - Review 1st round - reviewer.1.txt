Detailed comments to authors:


The authors propose and analyze some new methods for partitioning the relaxation variables added to soft clauses for solving the MaxSAT problem.
The paper is well-written and the results reported deserve to be published.
The reasons of the difference of performances among the various methods are clearly discussed.
The material and presentation is improved wrt the RCRA version.
Some Lemma is really trivial and can be omitted.
I have a general question on the applicability of a bisection scheme instead than a linear increasing one.
Perhaps the authors can briefly comment on that.

There are some minor issues reported below that should be addressed in the final version of the paper.

Minor comments

Page 2. After "solution or model." Add the notion of satisfiable/unsatisfiable formula.

"can have weights" maybe "can have integer weights"

"multiset of clauses." I would add "(i.e., we allow multiple occurrence of the same clause in a formula)"

Page 3. Def. 2.3 Remove "(i.e., ... formula)" - see comment above.
"the sum of n literals" Please clarify here that, i.e.,  true + true = 2

"We refer to the literature for B&B [1] and unsatisfiability based [2] algorithms." ->
"We refer to [1] for B&B algorithms and to [2] for unsatisfiability based [2] algorithms, respectively".

Page 4. Algo 1, Output. "satisfying assignment" it is not defined. Rather, you have defined it as a solution or model.

Why are you using "st" as variable name? "state"? Can you add a (minor of course) comment?

Page 6. Algo 2. You can remove V_R from instruction 1. It is initialized in instruction 2.

Page 7. The intensional set { omega_i \in phi_s : omega_i \cup {r_i} } should be:
 {   omega_i \cup {r_i} : omega_i \in phi_s}  Btw, this is the unique place where you use
":" (in the other sets you're using "|").

Page 10. Algo 3. Same observation above on V_R.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the paper, you received its workshop reviews as
well as a letter from the authors explaining how they have dealt with these
reviews in the current version.

Did authors properly took into account the comments of the workshop reviewers (other than you)?
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, completely


As a former reviewer of the workshop version of this paper,
are you satisfied with how authors took into account your own comments?
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, I'm fully satisfied


Overall judgement
(Please, delete all categories except one)


3 - Accept subject to minor revision
This is a good paper, of the same or of better quality wrt. the usual quality of articles
published in the major journals in the area.
There are only minor issues that should be solved before publication, but they do not seem
critical and appear easy to solve. Although I will take a final decision only after having quickly
reviewed the new version of the paper, I'm reasonably confident that there will be no bad surprises.
