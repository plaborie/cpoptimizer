Detailed comments to authors:


The authors present different methods for advancing MaxSAT solving when tackled with linear search algorithms.
At a first look the authors have added a good amount of new material in comparison to the workshop paper.
In particular, they now analyze how hybrid approaches influence the overall behaviour of the solver, what is the role of incremental solving, and showed proofs of correctness and termination.

However there are some issues in how the work is presented. 
First, I find a bit confusing how and when the authors talk about MaxSAT and Partial MaxSAT, it is not always clear what a technique is meant for. This affects abstract, introduction, and in smaller amount the preliminaries.
I find the examples presented throughout the paper quite good, but their description is definitely lenghty, could be made much more concise. Same partially applies to the experimental analysis section, where it would be nice to see a comparison of the uniquely solved problems.
What would you suggest to improve in model based approaches to make them stronger for pms_industrial problems?


Minor remarks: 
footnote 1, 'a' in "all" is the only italic letter
P16: "we must rebuilt" -> rebuild





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the paper, you received its workshop reviews as
well as a letter from the authors explaining how they have dealt with these 
reviews in the current version.

Did authors properly took into account the comments of the workshop reviewers (other than you)? 
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, completely (either by improving the paper or by giving convincing evidence 
  in the accompanying letter that addressing such comments would be out of the scope 
  of the paper or could/should not be done).

If you are not fully satisfied about how authors addressed comments of workshop reviewers, 
please explain why:





As a former reviewer of the workshop version of this paper, 
are you satisfied with how authors took into account your own comments?
(Please, delete all categories except one)

- Yes, I'm fully satisfied



Overall judgement

3 - Accept subject to minor revision 
This is a good paper, of the same or of better quality wrt. the usual quality of articles
published in the major journals in the area. 
There are only minor issues that should be solved before publication, but they do not seem 
critical and appear easy to solve. Although I will take a final decision only after having quickly 
reviewed the new version of the paper, I'm reasonably confident that there will be no bad surprises.
