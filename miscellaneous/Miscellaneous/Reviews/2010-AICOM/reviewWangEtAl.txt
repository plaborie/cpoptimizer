Title of the paper: 
Constraint-Based Methods for Scheduling Discretionary Services

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of questions you can use as guidelines for
your review. You can skip the questions and provide detailed
feedback in the "SCIENTIFIC REVIEWE SECTION"

1.  In which areas of Artificial Intelligence does the submitted article 
    propose a contribution?

The paper is a contribution in the planning and scheduling area as
well as in search and optimization. It presents two approaches mixing
constraint programming and mathematical programming to solve a
particular type of scheduling problem involving duration maximization.

2.  How relevant are these areas for Artificial Intelligence research
    today? (If not important then please explain):

These areas are clearly relevant to AI research today.

3.  Is the presentation in the article clear and easy to follow?

The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

4.  Is the grammar and spelling correct?

Yes.

A few typos:
- In the abstract: "implies exiting techniques"
- p10, col2: "the idea that that if there are"

5.  Are the figures and tables adequate?

Yes. The paper is very well illustrated with tables and pictures.

6.  Are the references correct and complete?

The main issue with the article is that it elaborates on two very
interesting papers published in 2005 ([39,32]) but does not bring any
new result compare to these original 5-years old papers and seem to
ignore some progress made on this scheduling problem since then.

In particular, it would be interesting to compare the proposed
approaches with the self-adapting large neighborhood search algorithm
described in:

P. Laborie and D. Godard. Self-Adapting Large Neighborhood Search:
Application to single-mode scheduling problems. Proc. MISTA 2007.

Where the authors claim an average improvement of 2.3% over the
quality ratios reported in [32]. Their approach also uses the POS and
linear optimization ingredients but in a different way as they are
integrated with LNS and learning techniques. Another difference is the
use of a search procedure that fixes dates instead of precedence
constraint posting.


7.  Does the article adequately relate its contribution to the current
    state of the art?

See above. From a general point of view, the article makes good
connections with the different works on related problems but it is
missing some important references on previous work applied to this
very same problem and instances.

8.  How significant and relevant is the paper for a journal publication?

This contribution is significant and relevant for publication in a
journal as AI Communication but it should be refreshed in light of the
progress on the state of the art since the original papers were
published in 2005.

9.  Is the paper technically sound?

The paper is technically sound but some claims should be precised. 

In particular in section 3, you mention that the proposed model can
easily be extended to problems where each activity requires more than
one unit of resource (say it requires n units). That's true but it
will result in a model that is n times larger which is pseudo
polynomial with the value of the resource required quantity. That may
turn out to be prohibitive in many real applications.
