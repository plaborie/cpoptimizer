Reviewer Blind Comments to Author

I still think that the article should be accepted because it is a very good contribution on the new propagators, but I'm not convinced by the answer on my comments 3 and 4:

3. About modeling precedence constraints with calendars in CP Optimizer:

"We thought about modeling precedence constraints as additional interval variables. But to the best of our knowledge negative time lags cannot be modeled and up to 50% of the temporal constraints within the used test instances have a negative time lag. We decided to model all temporal constraints in the same way and therefore we used IloStartBeforeStart constraints"

I do not see why negative time lags cannot be modeled this way. Suppose a negative time lag -D between S_i, the start time of activity A_i, and S_j the start time of activity A_j. The constraint says:

S_i - D(S_i) <= S_j where D(S_i) represents the duration D modulated by the calendars and ending at S_i (see your formula for tu_ij when time lag is negative.

You can easily model this negative time lag by an interval variable NEGLAG_ij of size D that ends S_i (endAtStart(NEGLAG_ij, A_i)) and constrain S_j to start after the start of this interval (startBeforeStart(NEGLAG_ij, A_j)). 

So all time lags can be modeled by introducing a new interval variable. 

4. About the modeling of sets W as step functions

The model with step functions helps to remove time granularity *during the resolution*. The computation of the step functions indeed would still depend on time-granularity but it is performed only once (and I don't believe it is expensive) before solving the problem, and all steps of the functions with the same value are merged, so that during resolution it only deals with contiguous intervals of same value. This would particularly help for instance when you use larger granularity factors in 5.7 or solve more realistic instances. Except for the case of the \rho=0 (which is a major contribution of the article), I think a CP Optimizer model would not depend at all on time granularity, whereas the investigation in 5.7 clearly shows that the resolution times of the proposed models increases linearly with the time factor.

Reviewer Confidential Comments to Editor

Summarize briefly the reasons for your recommendation:

I still think that the article should be accepted because it is a very good contribution on the new propagators, but I'm not convinced at all by the authors answer on my comments 3 and 4 (see above). I understand that, as a second round review, another recommendation as "Accept subject to minor revisions" may not be possible. But I would appreciate if the authors have another opportunity to answer my comments.
