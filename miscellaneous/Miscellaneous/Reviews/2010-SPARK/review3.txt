PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 
(will be sent to authors and distributed amongst attendees)

The extent of the problem addressed by this work is impressive
(planning, scheduling, execution, uncertainties, multi-objective,
multi-agent), especially if to consider that the objective was a real
evaluation of the system on some field tests. So I understand that
pragmatic questions needed pragmatic answers and that providing
strategic guidance to the system is a pragmatic answer to the
different sources of uncertainties in the problem. But this
complexifies the knowledge engineering aspects as there are now two
sources of knowledge for the application: (1) the model and (2) the
strategic guidelines meta-model. Do you think extending the
declarative model with some features for explicitly modeling and
reasoning about uncertainties is a viable alternative for this type of
application?


GENERAL COMMENTS 
(will be sent to authors)

The paper describes an application that implements a distributed
approach for disaster response scheduling. The problem is very
challenging because it covers planning and scheduling, plan execution,
uncertainties, multi-objective and mixed-initiative planning with
multiple autonomous agents. The topic is thus highly relevant for a
workshop like SPARK.

Given the extent of the problem, the approach is a pragmatic one that
integrates generic representation frameworks (CTAEMS, STNs) with
specific algorithms to schedule the different types of tasks
(located/not located tasks, handling of the multi-objective aspect)
and for coordination aspects. The design and implementation of the
complete application seem to represent a very significant effort, not
to mention the experimental part with a simulation in a real
environment which is something one seldom sees in an application
paper. 

This being said, the conclusions of the experimental part are not
clear. It is said that all the effort in the 72h period to tune the
application before running the scenarios was targeted to the first
scenario. Wouldn't we expect that the tactics used to guide the agent
system are independent from the actual scenarios? It would be
useful to also give the results obtained at field test by the
agent team on the last two scenarios.

Although the paper is in general clearly written and organized (I
particularly appreciate the effort to illustrate the different points
with small examples), some sections could be improved:

- the description of the quality propagator in section "Managing Local
Schedules" would deserve more precision. It is said that the objective
is to collect a "set" of activities that maximize quality (so one would
expect that the result is a set of activities with equal and optimal
quality) and below is mentioned that the allocator selects activities
from "this list" in decreasing order of quality ...

- later, in the same section, you mention a special heuristic for the
case of interdependent activities because the previously described
heuristic would be "myopic and suboptimal". But, even if activities
are not independent, the heuristic described in this section is
suboptimal, no? Otherwise, the TSP wouldn't be NP-complete.

- in the section on Arbitrating Task Assignments, the description of
the principles of C-Node Scheduling is OK but the details are not
clear. Shouldn't a C-Node be considered as hypothetical and thus,
never be executed by an agent until the agent knows it has won it? Why
should an agent start to travel to the location of a C-Node activity he
may loose? Also, I don't know if C-Node scheduling is an established
coordination mechanism in agent scheduling but if it is, you should
provide a reference.

A few typos:

- p6, beginning of section "Steering the Agent System", "at a site,the
  number": missing space

- p7, item "Kit Staging": "also also"

- p8, section "Results": Table 1 is referred to as a Figure 1 in the
  text.

SEED FOR JOURNAL?
Please comment whether this work could represent the seed for a journal paper

As mentioned in the future directions, the field tests have
undoubtedly brought many insights on important improvements of the
approach, particularly on the steering aspects. The figures on Table 1
show that the approach has potentials. I think that once these
potentials have been investigated, this work would perfectly fit for a
journal paper but, at the moment, this is probably too early.
