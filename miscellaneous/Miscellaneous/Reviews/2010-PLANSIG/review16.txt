*** REVIEW:

---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The paper describes tornado graphs and how they can be used both (1)
to illustrate and (2) to generate robust schedules. I find this
dichotomy somehow misleading. As stated in the section about tornado
graphs, this type of display may indeed be useful to visualize the
results of a sensitivity analysis performed on a limited number of
parameters and parameter changes that have been selected by an
expert. But I do not understand the claim that the approach for
improving schedule robustness described in the last section uses
tornado graphs. The approach uses classical sensitivity analysis (not
tornado graphs) and you use tornado graphs to justify and explain the
approach. That's why if the paper is about tornado graphs and their
application in scheduling I think most of the case study in last
section is off topic whereas if the paper is about the proposed
approach to generate robust schedules the notion of tornado graph is
not necessary. I'll separate the two topics in this review.

Tornado graphs

At reading the section about tornado graphs, one gets the impression
that they are well suited if one can identify a relatively small set
of homogeneous parameter changes. 

In scheduling, there are usually several sources of uncertainty like
release dates, activity durations, machine breakdowns, available
quantity of resources, etc. Are tornado graphs still relevant for
analyzing the impact of a set of non homogeneous parameters (say, the
release dates of some activities and the available quantity of some
resources) ? In this case, the "unit" of change on the left bars is
not well defined (unless if one uses one tornado graph per uncertainty
source type).

Another issue is how to select (1) the parameters and (2) their change
value displayed on the tornado graph. Real life scheduling problems
tend to be large (several hundreds or thousands of activities) and the
possible changes for a given parameter (for instance the possible
delay values for a release date or for an activity duration) may take
many possible values. And usually the impact on the cost of a
parameter change is not linear so selecting one or a couple of values
for the change can be insufficient to evaluate the impact. For
instance it could be that in the example, selecting a slightly larger
value for the duration increase of task 5 (say, value 5 instead of
value 3) leads to a much larger cost increase and that could even change
the comparison between the two schedules on Figures 1 and 2.

On those figures, the lefts bars are called "Duration
Uncertainty". This is misleading, this scale is about "Increase of
duration" and displays the impact of a given increase of duration for
a given task. This has nothing to do with the uncertainty on the
duration. If the actual duration is modeled as a random variable with
a probability distribution, the uncertainty would rather be related
with the standard deviation of the distribution. Maybe the change
value is selected according to the uncertainty but then, I think that
should be made more clear and probably more formal.

A detail: it is mentioned that the robustness measure (a non-negative
number) of the perfectly robust schedule is 0. That's a bit counter
intuitive as when the value of this "robustness" measure increases,
the schedule is less robust.

Generating robust schedules - Case Study

At the beginning of the section I think it would help for clarification
to state the problem in more formal terms.

The idea of the approach is interesting and I encourage the authors
pursuing in this direction but I find the paper does not bring enough
evidence that it works well:

- It is shown to work on a single instance of the problem. It would be
good to see how it behaves on other instances and to which extent it
depends on the selection of values for the task delays (here 5mn and
10mn).

- Is the rescheduling problem solved to optimality by the scheduling
algorithm? If not, the scheduling algorithm introduces some
uncertainties in the process (for some reason, it may be able to find
a solution very close to the optimal for some task change and a worse
solution for another one). This will bias the results, especially as
far as only one instance is used.

- What is the size of the problem? If the problem has n tasks and
there are k selected change values per task, do you solve one
rescheduling problem for each of the k*n tasks/changes combinations ?
Until an optimal solution is found (see item above) ?

I find this work is in a too early stage for presentation at
PlanSIG. My rating -1 takes into account the fact planSIG is a
workshop that encourages presentation of work in progress otherwise, I
would have rated the paper lower.
