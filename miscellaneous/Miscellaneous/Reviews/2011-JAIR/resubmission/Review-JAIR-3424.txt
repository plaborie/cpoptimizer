=========================================

The authors have improved many aspects of the paper, especially section 3 which 
is now much clearer and give enough explanations to ensure the technical 
soundness of the upper bound. Furthermore, the tightness of the proposed 
upper-bound is now considered in the experimental section and seems to show 
that this bound is indeed reasonably tight which justifies its use.

The study of schedule infeasibility could still be improved. In particular, the 
notion of a POS being "infeasible at an activity ai" seems to be ill-defined 
because it relies on its definition for a node aj with a temporal dependency 
with ai but the temporal dependencies may have cycles. The general RCPSP/max is 
defined with a set of temporal constraints Si + lij <= Sj with lij possibly 
negative so there is no natural order or topological sort of the activities. 
The article assumes that all temporal constraints are of the form Sj-Si in 
[TijMin, TijMax] with TijMin, TijMax non-negative but this is in fact less 
general than a set of relations Si + lij <= Sj. Example: S2-S1 in [-5,5] is 
allowed in a RCPSP/max (S1+(-5)<=S2 and S2+(-5)<=S1) but cannot be represented 
as Sj-Si in [TijMin, TijMax] with TijMin, TijMax *both* non-negative. My 
feeling is that the formulation of the upper-bound on schedule infeasibility 
(and, to a certain point, the local search based on list scheduling) rely on 
the fact temporal constraints are of the form [TijMin, TijMax] with TijMin, 
TijMax non-negative. That should be clarified.

The algorithm for finding a randomized start time schedule according to a given 
activity list in the presence of max delays should be explained more in detail. 
In particular, I do not see how a single run of a Floyd-Warshall algorithm 
(c.f. complexity analysis) could be sufficient. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm 
will only handle temporal constraints. How resource constraints are handled?

I recommend acceptance of the article but strongly encourage the authors to clarify the 
two points above for the final version of the article.

A few minor remarks: 
- Abstract: "However all existing methods assume that durations of activities 
  are known with certainty". The sentence may be misleading, I would precise 
  "However all existing methods for solving RCPSP/max assume ...".
- Section 4, p20: "make span" => "makespan"
- p22, "based on the its order"
- Section 7.4, p37: "the the Mean Normalized Makespan"

Comments to the Editor
=========================================

I recommend acceptance because the main contributions of the paper (the formulation of the 
upper bound on the robust makespan and the fact this upper bound is reasonably tight) are 
now established in some more solid basis in this revised version. 

I think the paper can be improved by clarifying:
 1. Some assumption that seems to be made about the fact not all negative time lags can be 
 handled (so it is a restriction to the general RCPSP/max). This restriction is not critical
 but it should be made explicit.
 2. The description of the algorithm for finding a randomized start time schedule according 
 to a given activity list.

Clarifying those two points is important but does not require any fundamental change in the 
paper. Furthermore, I find the authors have done a serious job at improving the paper following 
the reviewers comments (at least mines) and I'm quite confident they will handle the two points
I mentioned for the final version.
