Most of the ideas in the paper already have been described, implemented and tested in the IxTeT planning system. See for instance [1]. Most of these ideas also are present in the O-PLAN system [2].

More precisely:

- the need for handling abreast and in an opportunistic way planning and scheduling

- the identification of the different types of flaws in a planning and scheduling model (open preconditions, threads, resource over-allocation conflicts)

- the idea of maintaining two constraints networks:
 * one dealing with the set of temporal constraints TC using a STP
 * the other one for dealing with non-temporal variables constraints VC which handles co-designation, non-codesignation and domain constraints

- the idea of having specialized modules for detecting each type of flaw

- the identification of the different plan modifications/flaw resolvers to refine the current partial plan and gradually eliminate flaws

- the important fact that flaws can be treated in a way that is completely independent from their origin (planning or scheduling
flaw). So the flaw and plan modification selection can be done in a completely transversal way with respect to flaw detection. This allows for a real interleaving of planning and scheduling decisions during problem solving.

- inference being systematically performed for those flaws associated with a unique plan modification (no disjunction)

- some least-commitment heuristics based on a commitment measure attached to a disjunction of plan modifications.

- the proof that the global approach is sound and complete. 

So the approach described and implemented in IxTeT and O-PLAN should be cited and the actual contribution of the paper should be analyzed in comparison with these previous approaches.

I think the main contribution of the paper is to extend the above approach to the case of hybrid planning (IxTeT being more a kind of pure POCL planning system, O-PLAN being more an HTN planner).

In the definition of flaws, I think a distinction should be made between the "potential" flaws that can be solved by refining the current partial plan and "actual" flaws that basically lead to a backtrack in the search tree. The actual flaws (F_OrdInconsistency, F_VarInconsistency and F_TempInconsistency) clearly cannot be resolved by monotonous plan modifications, as mentioned in the end of section 2.

It is not clear why plan modification RefineTempConstraint is different from AddTempConstraint as the refined temporal constraint is always stronger than the original one.

In the least commitment first strategy, the commitment contribution of a modification that answers the flaw is 1, independently of how much the modification constrains the current partial plan (for instance adding x=y is considered as having the same commitment as adding x<=y). This measure looks a bit naive, especially given the absence of experiments to justify it.

It seems that the question of how to detect the different flaws is left aside. In particular, there seems to be an exponential number of SymbolicOverAllocation flaws. How are they selected and computed?
