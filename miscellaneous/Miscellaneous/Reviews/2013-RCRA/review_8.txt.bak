Review

Review (*)

The paper describes a follow-up on the work on APSI-TRF. The focus here is on providing a software architecture on top of the APSI-TRF modeling layer for making it easier to implement different solvers. It is a valuable contribution to the effort of rationalizing complex planning and scheduling frameworks from a software engineering perspective.

The distinction between the Engine and the Strategy layer is well motivated as the bottom line seems to be that the engine layer is in charge of the few mechanisms that are responsible for ensuring the semantics of the TRF model and the correctness of the solution whereas the strategy level is in charge of exploring the search space. The two other layers (Solver layer and Application layer) would deserve a more detailed description, in particular where is the dotted line between the Strategy and the Solver layer. 

Given the focus of the paper, in the experimental section it would be useful to give an idea of the effort it took to develop the solvers for the GOAC and FSL domains and to have an idea how this effort was split between the different layers (engine/strategy/solver/application).

For both application domains GOAC and FSL, it seems that the problem consists in finding a feasible solution and that there is no plan quality measures. The different approaches are compared according to the execution time of the planner for finding a solution. I suppose that in the actual applications, plan quality plays a role. How is this usually taken into account ? Does EPSL provides room for optimization techniques?
