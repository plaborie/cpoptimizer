Review

Review (*)

The paper proposes a set of algorithms for solving MaxSAT problems and compares them on a few benchmarks. 
Three algorithms are proposed:
- LinearMS which is a well known algorithm
- ModelMS which is an adaptation of an existing algorithm originally proposed for solving MinSAT problems
- PartMS which is an original algorithm introduced in the present paper

The idea underlying PartMS is very interesting. It builds on both LinearMS (idea of an iterative solve of a SAT problem with a cardinality constraint) and ModelMS (idea to use less variables in the cardinality constraint as large cardinality constraints result in loose inference in the SAT engines) by trying to keep, as much as possible, the enforcement of satisfied clauses from the previous iteration. This results in a much tighter SAT problem. And when this tighter problem becomes unsatisfiable, PartMS relies on the production of certificate of unsatisfiability to move clauses in the cardinality constraint (from inactive to active relaxation variables).

In the experimental section, the 3 algorithms are compared together and against QMaxSAT a solver that entered the Max-SAT 2012 Evaluation and behaved well on the partial MaxSAT industrial instances. Experiments show that ModelMS and PartMS are complementary and can be competitive with QMaxSAT.

The paper is fairly relevant to the call for paper as it is about comparing algorithms from an experimental viewpoint although the focus seems to be more on the description of the algorithm than on the evaluation itself. The paper is well written and very clear. The reason is probably that the idea proposed in PartMS is in fact very simple and this is what makes it quite elegant.

In the context of an extended journal version of the paper, I think two aspects should be extended:
- the idea to hybridize ModelMS and PartMS to better exploit their complementarity
- an extension of the experimental study in particular on other types of MaxSAT instances and other state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers (indeed, except for the partial MaxSAT industrial instances, QMaxSAT does not seem to behave that well on other benchmarks).
