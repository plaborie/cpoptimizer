Review

Review (*)

The paper proposes an alternative approach using a MIP model to a very challenging problem of optimally placing valves in a water distribution network. A first approach using CLP was proposed by the same authors a couple of years ago. 

The paper focuses on the MIP model, which is quite interesting. But this leaves not much space for the experimental section. The present MIP approach still seems to be quite far from the performance of the CLP approach (both in running time for optimality proof and in solution quality). The interest of the MIP approach compared with CLP should be clarified (do you have some reasons to believe this MIP approach can be improved? does it have other advantages like the extendability to additional side-constraints/objectives? ...) 

As far as a potential extended version for a journal is concerned, I think work should be done to strenghten the current MIP model in order to make it competitive with the CLP approach.


Confidential remarks for the program committee

In fact the significance of the paper is not evident (I hesitated on the ranking between 1/poor and 2/fair). The authors propose an alternative approach (MIP) to another approach they worked on some time ago (CLP). But the present alternative approach is not really competitive with CLP and there is no real evidence that it can be improved.
