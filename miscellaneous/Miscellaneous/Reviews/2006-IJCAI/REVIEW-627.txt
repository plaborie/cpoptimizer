Comments to author(s):

This paper describes the following contributions:
- an extension of the DTPP framework, called MC-DTPP, to allow the
expression of multi-criteria and compose them using Multi-Attribute
Utility Theory (MAUT).
- two algorithms for solving the problem
- an experimental evaluation 

The model extension mainly consists in using a MAUT objective function
with a two-additive Choquet integral as aggregation function. The
approach is not new but its application to DTPP seems to be
original. The extension is well motivated by an interesting example
inspired from an actual application.

The time numbers on Figure 1 are not at the right place, they should
be lifted to the left as one gets the feeling that lunch time is
between 11:30 and 12:30.

In section 4.2, after the definition of u_i in equation (5), it is
not clear why if all constraints are satisfied to their lowest
preference levels, the utility is 0. Can't the lowest preference level
of a constraint be strictly positive?

The claim that the MC-DTPP can express any of the existing DTPP
objective functions (col1, p4) does not seem to be true as, precisely,
the maximin criterion cannot be modelled with the two-additive Choquet
integral. For that, one needs the full Choquet integral which may be
more complex to compute and seems to be, for that reason, outside the
scope of MC-DTPP. I think this claim of additional expressivity should
be softened.

The algorithms for solving MC-DTPP use the existing MCS framework
which is composed of two ingredients:
- a mono-criterion search 
- a way to combine mono-criterion searches in order to reach a global
  optimum

In the paragraph that describes the principles of the MCS approach, it
should be precised that the global optimality is ensured only if some
"weak completeness" property of the mono-criterion search holds.

The mono-criterion search proposed in the paper is a direct adaptation
of the preference slicing algorithm already described in [1] where it
is explained how to convert a DTPP into a VDTP. In the present paper,
only the objective function changes.

The way to combine mono-criterion searches is not detailed in the
paper. It makes it really hard to assess the interest of the
preliminary experimental results. I think the paper should give more
details about the algorithms and save some space in section 4.1
that describes the motivating example. 

In the experimental study, you should say something about the way the
matrix A is generated. How realistic is this criterion, how "far" is
it from the utilitarian one (sum), or from the local approximation of
maximin mentioned on page 4?

The comparison between Multilitis-MC/MP and Multilitis-BB is not
really informative given that the heuristics are not described in the
paper (they probably have a strong impact on the performances) and
that the two approaches explore the search space in very different
ways (iterative solve v.s. unique search tree).

For the comparison between Multilitis-BB and WeightWatcher, was the
same heuristic used to solve the meta-CSP?

Confidential comments to PC members:

The paper is a sum of small contributions and putting several existing
techniques together in the context of DTPP. The paper is nice but I'm
not sure the global contribution is sufficient for IJCAI.
