Recommendation: Reject?

There are several issues with the paper:
- the positioning with respect to the state of the art on the ridesharing family of problems is not clear
- the contribution of the paper is not clearly stated, in particular does it solve a new variant of the problem or a previously known one
- the justification for the definition of the quality of service measurement is weak
- the experimental section does not clearly show the added value of the approach
