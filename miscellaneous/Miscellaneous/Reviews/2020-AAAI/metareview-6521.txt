Recommendation: Reject?

The contribution of the paper is very incremental as it mainly consists of a new selection strategy
for the pair selection for crossover in an already known memetic algorithm for solving the VRPTW.
The strategy tries to balance exploration and exploitation.

Although the approaches improves the best known results of many instances of some public benchmark
(which clearly is a good result), the experimental study in particular the analysis of the
advantage of the proposed pair selection compared to existing ones is not sufficiently convincing.
If the base method is already a state-of-the-art method, it is not really surprising that some delta
on top of it (like here the new selection mechanism), even if it does not represent a significative
added value can improve the results just because it changes the randomized traversal of the search space.
