Recommendation: Accept?

The contribution of the paper is on complexity analysis of a problem for optimizing reachability
sets in temporal graphs by different forms of delaying.

All reviewers agree on the importance, interest and originality of the contribution.

The article is more on the theoretical side (complexity analysis) than about a practical resolution of the problem.
The paper provides non-trivial results and is technically sound.

The main discussion is whether or not such a complexity analysis paper fits the topics of AAAI conference.
I think it does, in light of many complexity analysis papers accepted in past AAAI conferences,
even if, I agree, the paper could be improved by briefly describing some use-cases for the proposed delaying schemes.
