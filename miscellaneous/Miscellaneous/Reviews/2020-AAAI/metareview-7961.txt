Recommendation: Reject?

The two proposed methods are interesting and this work clearly worth pursuing.

Still, all three reviewers agree on the weaknesses of the current paper:

- The proposed globally optimal solution to the noiseless case is not novel and is in fact quite trivial.

- The experimental evaluation for assessing the robustness of the approaches is not convincing
  enough as it is based only on syntactic data and lacks a comparison against existing alternative methods
