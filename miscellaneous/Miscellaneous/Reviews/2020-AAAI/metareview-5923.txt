Dicsussion:

Discuss with reviewer 1 who did not really understand the paper


Recommendation: Reject?

After rebuttal, all reviewers agree on the theoretical contribution of the paper for understanding
the complexity of several fragments of the (M)RCPSP global framework.
While these theoretical results do not seem directly usable for the practical resolution of the
problems (the polynomial degree of the algorithm complexity is in general huge), these are clearly
non-trivial results. But I'm really not sure AAAI conference is the right place for publishing these
results, for two reasons:
- given the particular focus of the paper at the intersection of
  pure scheduling (for a generic but very particular scheduling problem: the MRCPSP with
  makespan minimization) and theoretical complexity analysis.
- for the quantity of material that would be required for a full description of the contribution
  (as done in the provided full version of the paper) as mentioned by reviewer #2
For these reasons, I would advice the authors to better submit the paper at a more focused conference
on theoretical scheduling (like MISTA, PMS) or a scheduling journal.
