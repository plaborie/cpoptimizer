The article introduces a variant of the classical Resource-Constrained Project-Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) with selfish individual agents bidding for the different tasks of the scheduling problem. This is a very interesting and original mix of scheduling and auction theories applied to a complex problem.

The paper is essentially a theoretical paper with a formal presentation of the problem, the description and comparison of some mechanisms to solve it and some proofs about these mechanisms. A detailed MILP model for solving the first part of the problem (computing task allocation and execution policy) is also described. 

I must say that I'm a scheduling expert with almost no background on auction theory, so the part of the paper on the different auction mechanisms is the one I have the most comments on:
- I think you should explain the VCG acronym when you first use it. 
- For the each of the mechanisms described in the paper (VCG,SCP,ICP), is it the case that the payment received by each agent i, if it is selected for a task q, will always be greater or equal to its reported cost C^i(q) ? It seems that this property is important (because otherwise the agent has no guarantee about its payment; and this is something that seem to hold in "classical" VCG mechanisms) but looking at the maths in the paper, it is not clear if this property hold. I think this should be clarified.
- The optimization model maximizes the global welfare but does not really optimize the POS (execution policy) itself. For a given optimal solution to the formulation on Table 1, there is a huge number of possible POSs with, potentially, very different characteristics. For example as far as "flexibility" is concerned, [1] showed that different "optimal" POS (optimal in the sense they are compatible with an optimal solution with fixed start/end times) may have very different flexibility value. So I'm wondering how the POS selected in the optimization step impacts the different mechanisms. Different "optimal" POS y* will lead to different payments to the agents. Could we show that some are better than others? Couldn't it be a way for the center to be unfair to some agents? 
- On a similar line, the way the overall value V is distributed over all the agents (V^i), directly impacts the payments. Even if, as shown in the paper, it does not impact the properties of the mechanisms, it seems to impact the payments through formulas (3) and (5) so can one consider some distribution functions better than others ? Actually, I'm wondering why the W^{-i,i}(...) in equation 3 is not just W(...)
- The notations are very complex. I understand it may be difficult to simplify them because you are dealing with many contexts. But for instance there are places where the notations are not homogeneous like \theta^i for the type of agent i (Table 2) whereas \theta_i is used in section 4.1 when defining \theta^{-i} = \{ \theta_1,...}. Also, if in the SCP and ICP mechanism the payment function depend both on the declared types and the actual types, why the function (in formula 2 and 4) only have the declared types as argument? And in equation (6), shouldn't it be -C^i(\theta) instead of -C^i(\hat{\theta}) as it uses the actual cost.

Overall, I find the paper is original and very relevant to the conference. From the point of view of organization of the paper, maybe subsection 4.2 which is about some properties of the mechanism could be moved after the MILP section.

The parts of the paper related with auction theory is difficult to read, mostly because of complex notations as mentioned above.

Some more detailed comments and typos:

- when introducing the precedence constraints of the RCPSP in section 3, it is strange to mention them as "setup-times" as usually, "setup-times" are delays between the end of an operation and the start of the next operation on a unary resource that, quite often, depend on the (unknown) sequencing of the activities on the machine. Plain precedence constraints as in the RCPSP are something much simpler.

- at the same place, the citation [Pinedo,2015] is not very informative. If you want to cite the book, please give more information in the reference.

- section 4.2: "consider a[n] simple case"

Strong points:
  - Originality: first time auction theory is integrated with RCPSP in order to select the (selfish) agents that will perform the tasks
  - Main contributions:
    * Formal description of the problem
    * Proposal of 2 auction mechanisms (SCP,ICP)
    * Proofs of some properties of these mechanisms
    * Description of an approach to solve the problem

Weak points:
  - Some missing references (about the related hiring-a-team problem, about game theory approaches in project scheduling)
  - In particular, some effort should be made to explain the main differences with the hiring-a-team problem
  - The approach proposed to solve the central problem (a MILP) may not be the most efficient one

Summary of discussions:
  - All the reviewers agreed about the originality of the paper 
  - The paper being more on the theoretical side than on the experimental one, reviewers agreed that the 
    weakness of the proposed MILP model is not really an issue 
  - Probably the paper does not go far enough into the analysis of the specificities of using auction theory in a 
    detailed scheduling framework like the RCPSP, but it is an interesting starting point. We think that this type of paper 
    can attract the attention of scheduling researchers on this type of problem

RECOMMENDATION: ACCEPT
