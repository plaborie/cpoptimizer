The paper defines a scheduling problem on one machine with production and preventive maintenance activities. Duration of both production and maintenance activity is modeled as a triangular fuzzy number. The problem is to minimize a combination of makespan and temporal preference on the timing of maintenance activities. The proposed approach is a Genetic Algorithm.

Although the problem - as a mix of different features - seems original, each of the components of the problem (mix of production and maintenance, fuzzy durations) have been already been studied in itself. For instance in [1] some GAs are described for a multi-machine problem mixing production and maintenance with composite objective. The additional aspect of fuzzy duration is not treated in [1] but generalization is quite direct. The limitation to a single machine in the present paper is very limitative from a practical point of view.

Although the problem treated in the present paper should be quite easy to describe, its presentation is really not clear, it lacks some formal description and the notations are somehow heavy. For instance you say the processing time p_i AND the completion times c_i are fuzzy. But completion times are not given as input to the problem, so they are fuzzy as a consequence of the fuzziness of processing times together with an execution policy to start the activities as soon as possible. The section on problem description should be more formalized and not only describe the notations in the text. The same can be said about the algorithms 2 and 3, the sentences in the algorithms are not precise enough, they should be replaced with some maths to clear the ambiguities.

There are a number of typos in the notations. Particularly in section 4.1 around the explanation of the comparison between fuzzy objective values with a mix of subscript and superscript for "a". This part is very obscure.

In general the figures are of quite bad quality (Figure 1 looks, well ... fuzzy) and not very informative because they are missing some explanation (example: what are the t^i in Figure 2. The start times of activities?).

Strong points of the paper:
 - Interesting problem with integration of both production and maintenance activities using human resources with skills, even if this type of problem was already treated separately (problems mixing production and maintenance in production scheduling, problems with allocation of skilled resources in project scheduling), or even as a whole (it can be considered as a very special case of multi-mode RCPSP)

Weak points of the paper:
 - The paper lacks of clarity
 - Experimental study is not compelling
 - Restriction to single machine is very limitative
 - Novel technical contribution is limited
 
Impact of rebuttal:
 - The rebuttal did not change the original assessment of the reviewers

RECOMMENDATION: REJECT
