The paper makes the following contributions:
- A formal description of the Balanced Weekend Tournaments Problem (BWTP) with n teams (n is necessarily even)
- A constructive proof (by recursion) that there exist a solution to the BWTP for any n >= 8
- An interesting connection with graph theory and the problem of Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs K_n^*
- The proof of non-existence of perfectly balanced solutions for the BWTP
- Upper bounds for some norms measuring solution unbalancing, based on the proposed recursive approach
- Proposal of some interesting open problems

The article makes some very interesting contributions. The domain of application is a bit narrow (a particular sport scheduling problem, even if many instances of this problem exist) but the connection with Hamiltonian cycles decomposition in graph theory may open additional applications.

The paper is well written and organised and in general, not so difficult to read. Still, there are two places where the paper could be improved for better readability:

* The large figures on table 5 and 6 are split and it makes it difficult to follow the construction of the schedules by blocks as the different blocks are split. I'm not sure what could be done to improve that, except for using a single column for these figures and/or using less space for each the columns in the schedule. At least, you should avoid cutting a week-end (like col 15-16 on Table 5, or 13-14 on Table 6). It could be also interesting to use some more or less grey background to identify the different blocks

* In the section "Hamiltonian Decompositions", in the second column, what you are trying to achieve is very clear until the point you show the set of Hamiltonian decompositions that you extract from the 8-teams BWTP solution: "... (18473652), and (17264385).". At this point, the reader thinks that the connection with Hamiltonian decomposition is made, and that the two problems are equivalent. Then, it is difficult to see where you want to go from there. And it is only much later that the reader realises that:
(1) not all the solutions to the BWTP allow building an Hamiltonian cycle decomposition and (2) even not all the solutions to the BWTP *generated by the recursive algorithm* allow it. Which explains why you need to refine the construction of Hamiltonian cycle decomposition from the solutions to the BWTP. Readibility would be improved by clearly stating it at this point.

The paper is missing a conclusion that could provide a global view on the contribution. Maybe you could say something around the questions below [QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] (this is just a suggestion)

One interesting thing with the connection to the Hamiltonian cycle decomposition problem seems to be that it permits to distinguish different topologies of solutions to the BWT problem (with/without switching edges). The different construction methods for S_2k and S_2k-2 also seem to suggest that the solutions may look quite different depending on the parity of n/2. I say "may" because the construction method only provide "one" solution to the problem, probably with some very specific structure. So, more generally, I'm wondering how the different solutions to the BWTP look like: beside evident symmetries due to the team identifiers, are there other interesting symmetries in the solutions ? If we reason modulo these symmetries, are there many solutions with different "topologies" to the problem ? does this number grow with the number of teams ? Do you have some ideas/intuitions about these (very open) questions ?
