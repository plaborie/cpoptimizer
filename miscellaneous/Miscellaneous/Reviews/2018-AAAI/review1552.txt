PAPER 1552: Resource-Constrained Scheduling for Maritime Traffic Management

1.		[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.
 		( Required, Visible To Authors During Feedback and After Decision Notification )

The paper presents an interesting scheduling application for maritime traffic management. 
The problem is formalized as an extension of the classical RCPSP problem (variable activity duration and precedence constraints with no-wait time) and a combinatorial Benders approach is proposed to solve the problem. 
The approached is compared against a classicla Benders deomposition and a plain Constraint Programming model on some synthetic instances. 
Results are also reported for the proposed approach on some more realistic instances.

The article deals with an interesting real-life scheduling problem. 
It is well written and well structured. 
The ideas underlying the combinatorial Benders approach are original.
Most of my comments and questions are related with the experimental section:

1/ It would be useful to say more about the baseline CP model. This model is not described at all in the article. I understand that it is not possible to describe it by lack of place. Maybe it could be described in some supplementary material ?

2/ I think the generated instances should be made available to the community for future comparison of alternative approaches (and also if possible the real-world instances if there is no confidentiality issue). That would be an additional contribution of the paper.

3/ As far as the real-world instances are concerned, the paper does not give any clue about the size of the problem (number of vessels, number of activities, ...). How comparable is it with the randomly generated instances? Did you try the other approaches (classical Benders decomposition and baseline CP model) on the real-world instances too ?


9.		[QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] Please provide questions for authors to address during the author feedback period.
 		( Required, Visible To Authors During Feedback and After Decision Notification )

1/ Could you say a few words about the baseline CP model ? 

2/ Do you plan to make some of the instances publicaly available in the final version of the paper ?

3/ Did you try the alternative approaches on the real-world instances too ? If yes, how did they compare ? What is the typical size of the real-world instances ?

I must say that I reviewed an earlier version of this paper that was originally submited to IJCAI-2017 (and rejected).
The present version of the paper really adresses most of the issues that were raised by the reviewers at this time (in particular, 1- the lack or realism of the objective function -> now the objective function is much more realistic, and 2- no comparison with CP approaches -> now done). This new paper is really stronger than the IJCAI version.
