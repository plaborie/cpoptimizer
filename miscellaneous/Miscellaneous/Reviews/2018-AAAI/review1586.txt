PAPER 1586: Vehicle Routing with Multiple Trips and Time Windows

1.		[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.
 		( Required, Visible To Authors During Feedback and After Decision Notification )

The article considers a vehicle routing problem with multiple trips and time windows previously described in the literature. 
After (re-)describing the problem in detail and why this problem is important, it proposes a new MIP formulation that is shown to outperform the previous MIP formulation on the problem for small instances. For larger instances, the paper proposes a new heuristic approach based on iteratively solving the MIP model on a rolling horizon. This approach is show to behave better than the original GA algorithm.

The problem considered in the paper is interesting and important. In general the paper is well structured, but the writting is not really good (English, typos). Still, it is comprehensible enough.

The proposed MIP model is only moderately original as it mixes a classical disjunctive model (variables x_{a1,i1}^{a2,i2}) with a rank-based model (variables z_k^{a,i}, see [1] for example).

[1] H. M. Wagner, An integer linear-programming model for machine scheduling, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly 6 (2) (1959) 131–140.

In general, even if the proposed MIP model is more efficient than the one of the reference paper (Dang et al 2014), it is surprising that it requires so much time given the very small size of the problem (see Table 3). Indeed, the cases D-1 and D2 contains only 10 feeding tasks (with some subsets of 4 tasks already ordered on each of the feeders 1 and 4). So, the total number of possible ordering of the feeding activities is no more than 10! / (4!*4!) = 6300. Even in the worst case where we would consider the possibility of returning to the wharehouse after each feeding (2^10), the number of feasible sequences for the robot does not exceed 6.451.200. So a brute force search would I think be faster than the proposed MIP.

In this context, the GA of the reference paper really does not seem to behave well on this tiny problem as it cannot find the optimal solution. So the comparison with this GA on Table 4 does not give much information about the intrinseque quality of the proposed short window method. In this context, it would be very useful to study some methods for producing lower-bounds on the traveled distance and study the gap of the proposed heuristics.

I understand that maybe you did not include some of your experiments/results by lack of place in the paper. I think that some place could be saved in the problem description and in the beginning of the mathematical formulation. As you start from a definition of the problem as a VRPMTTW (and even actually as a TSPMTTW as only a single robot is considered in this work), maybe it is not necessary to explain how the time-windows are computed in the particular application treated in (Dang et al 2014). 

I do not understand the statement that the proposed MIP "has linear size of constraints". From my understanding, the number of constraints is quadratic, if only, because of constraints (9) that hold between each pair of task.

So I think that this work could be made much stronger by:
- continuing to work on the MIP formulation or on other exact approaches for small to medium-size problems (I think using Constraint Programming for this probem could be a good fit)
- providing a more convincing assessment of the quality of the heuristic by computing lower bounds (they could typically be based on some relaxations of the problem as TSP or TSPTW + minimal number of tasks at the wharehouse)

Some more detailed remarks, typos and/or formulation problems:

- p1, abstract, last sentence: "... and can satisfy[-ing] [+the] requirement[+s] in [+a] real production environment"

- p1, introduction: what is the "Smart Nations and Future of Factory" ?

- p1, introduction, col2: "the robots need to strict[+ly] respect [-to] the time windows of feeders"

- p4, in description of variable z_k^{a,i}: "is assigned to the kth task in the all tasks" (among all tasks ?)

- p5, section 5, equation (24): "constrai[+n]ts (2-22)"

- on Table 3, the notation for the times of the 2-Index MIP is not clear (for instance 1~1152)

 		( Required, Visible To Authors During Feedback and After Decision Notification )

In the reference paper, the proposed methods where tested on a large number of instances with robots capacities and horizon, but also varying the other parameteres like the number of feeders, min/max number of parts and part feeding rates, ... Did you try your two approaches (MIP and short window method) on the complete benchmark ?
