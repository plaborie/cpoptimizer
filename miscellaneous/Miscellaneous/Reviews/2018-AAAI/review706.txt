The paper first formulates the problem of STN under dynamic resource pricing. 

The main result of the paper is that this problem has polynomial complexity for piecewise constant functions. This is a new and significant result. 
The problem can be thought off as an allocation problem where you must find the best allocation of events to the different segments of the piecewise constant function so as to minimise total resource price. Generally speaking the set of feasible allocations, or complementarily the set of infeasible allocations, can be represented as an hypergraph. The authors show that in fact, this hypergraph can be reduced to a graph (theorem 6) and even that this graph is the one of a POSET relation (theorem 13). Finding the optimal solution to the original problem then boils down to finding the maximum weighted independent set of this graph, which is a polynomial problem. 

The authors describe a constructive polynomial algorithm for solving the problem. They also discuss some extensions of the problem where the function is piecewise linear and may also depend on the total demand.

The main result of the paper is clearly interesting and, to the best of my knowledge, original. 
It is significant because it holds for any stepwise function f(t) and does not rely on other properties of the function. 
This is a strong theoretical result.

The paper is well written, with a real effort to explain and illustrate all the steps that lead to the polynomiality proof. 

My main question (but I understand that is is perfectly legitimate to consider it as being out of the scope of the present paper) is on the practical application of the proposed algorithm to solve problems of realistic size (see questions).

Here are some more detailed comments:

* Fig 3: The figure is nice with colours, but much more difficult to understand in monochrome. Maybe you should use different line styles in addition of colours, and avoid mentioning the colours in the caption. 

* Concerning the extension to model (A) with piecewise linear function, I do not understand why the function is piecewise linear only on narrow intervals. It seems to me it depends on the duration of the processes: if you have long processes, you will probably have long intervals where the function is piecewise linear. In particular if the duration of processes is in the same order (or larger than) the typical intervals where f is constant, the resulting function will mostly be piecewise linear. 

* Although the problems are apparently different, it seems to me that for the case of concave functions mentioned in the paper, it could be worth having a look at this recent article [1]. At least, it also suggest an alternative energy consumption model (C) where the processes are free to consume their entire energy requirement Wi as they want along time (elastic processes).

I really enjoyed the paper. My questions are more forward looking.

The complexity of the algorithm in O(K^2 N |E|), so O(N^3 |E|) if you have costs on all tasks of the network, looks at first sight quite large for solving realistic problems. I'm wondering if you have some ideas how this complexity could be improved ? 

In the paper, you assume fixed duration of processes. Did you try to analyse the implications of having a variable duration ? (Both for model (A) and model (B))

Concerning piecewise linear functions, you propose to discretise them in order to get back to the case of step functions. This may be a good idea in some practical cases but from a theoretical point of view, it only shows that the problem with pwl functions is pseudo-polynomial. What about some (hard) polynomiality results for the problem with pwl functions ?
