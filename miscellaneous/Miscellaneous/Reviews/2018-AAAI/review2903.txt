PAPER 2903: Scheduling in Visual Fog Computing: NP-Completeness and Practical Efficient Solutions

1.		[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.
 		( Required, Visible To Authors During Feedback and After Decision Notification )

The article introduces and formally defines the problem of visual fog computing scheduling. 
It shows that the problem is NP complete and provides two MIP formulations. 
An experimental study shows that the second (more compact) model is more efficient and can scale to real size problems.

The combinatorial optimization problem treated in this paper is interesting and (to the best of my knowledge) original.

The paper is in general well written and organised but there are a few very annoying typos that make it harder to read than it could be. 
Except for these, the maths fortunately remove the ambiguities but still, here and there, some formulations could be improved by adding some more informal descriptions (see detailed comments below).

The section on NP-completeness is of course interesting but is quite straightforward so if necessary, I think some space could be saved here. In this section I'm wondering what is the added value of citation (Weinmman 2011). The CC problem is just a small generalisation of the well-known bin-packing problem (Problem SR1 in Garey-Johnson) so it is clearly NP-complete and you might as well want to cite or mention this problem and directly reduce bin-packing to VFC.

There are a number of assumptions or on the opposite, generalisations in the problem formulation that would necessitate a bit more description, especially for the readers who are not experts in visual fog computing, in particular concerning the characteristics of the device connectivity graph:
- why can we reasonably assume this graph is a DAG? Do cycles really make no sense? Why is it directed ? Couldn't we have some general graph topology in the middle between the source and the sink ?
- in the experimental section, you mention that realistic visual fog device graphs are just (directed) trees. In this case, it would probably be also interesting to focus on trees instead of general DAGs. I guess there may be more specialised and efficient models that exploit the fact the DAG is a tree.

On the same line, it would be interesting to justify why jobs are modelled as a chain of tasks rather than for instance a more general DAG.

I think some space could maybe be saved in the paper to address the above problem by just removing the ILP-T model (section 5.2 and related evaluation in the experimental section). I see two reasons for that: (1) this model is not really more simple than the better ILP-D model and does not help understanding the ILP-D model and (2) one clearly sees that because of its exponentially growing size, this model is not realistic. My feeling is that it would be better to directly focus on the more interesting formulation ILP-D which is indeed, quite smart.

I'm wondering why the problem is called a "scheduling" problem. In general, scheduling problems involve a temporal dimension (some tasks need to be executed before others due to resource limitations). In the described VFC problem, it seems all tasks run in parallel and there is even not any notion of duration for tasks. For me it sounds more like a spatial configuration problem: you need to allocate the tasks and communication between tasks and the devices and arcs of the physical network. Then everything gets executed in parallel.

More detailed comments and typos:

- p3, col 1, in definition of the task dependency graph: I suppose the set of arcs in this graph G_J is not E_D but E_J. This typo is very annoying as it is even repeated two lines below in the definition of G_J^i. It is only later in the paper that one clearly sees the essential difference between E_D and E_J ...

- p3, col1, in the sechedule definition : "a schedule [-that] maps an edge in G_J ..." I think "that" should be removed otherwise there is no verb in the sentence

- p6, section 5.3, there is a lack of homogeneity in the definition of h between equation (28) and equation (30). You say that h is not a function but a relation (which can be understood from equation 28) but then, equation (30) suggests that h is a function. Namely, h_function(v) is the set of all u such that h_relation(u,v). I would suggest to define h as a function whose value is a set as in (30).

- p6, section 5.3, just below, "the reverse schedule h is a dual of f": be careful when using the concept of "duality". In Linear Programming this concept is heavily known and used with a different meaning.

- p6, section 5.3: in the formulation, I think you should informally describe what represent the variables x_d,e^j: something like "x_d,e^j=1 iff device connection d belongs to the path used for realising task dependency e of task j". This meaning is clear when reading the maths but a sentence would help. On a similar line, in the formulation of constraints (33-35), you could say that these constraints are some sort of flow conservation constraints on the graph. And the, indeed quite smart, formulation of the device capacity constraint in equation (38-39) would also deserve a longer explanation, with maybe an example on a figure.

- in the experiments on Fig 5 and 6, what does the "task length" means? I guess it is the number of tasks in a job, right? And also, it is never mentioned how many jobs are considered. Do you implicitly consider that you have one job per source device? This really should be said somewhere.

- Do you have some comments on the fact the problem does not really sound like a "scheduling" problem ? By the way, would you see some extensions to real "scheduling" issues in the visual fog computing problem (like, involving task duration and sequences of tasks on the different devices). I suspect that there is no "real parallelism" of the tasks always needed and sometime the result of some computation of a task could be stored and used by another task of the job later. What do you think?

- Could you elaborate on the choice of a DAG to represent the device connection graph and not of a more general graph with possible cycles or on the contrary by directly working on a more specific class of graph like the tree you mention.

The paper could be improved on the form so as to make it easier to read but it is really interesting and original. Even with its problems on the form, the paper is quite understandable and non-ambiguous because of the maths and most of the problems I mention can easily be fixed in a final version, that's why I'm leaning to accept it.
