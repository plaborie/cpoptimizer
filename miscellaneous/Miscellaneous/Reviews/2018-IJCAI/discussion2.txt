The article describes a very involved heuristic for solving the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSSP). The general framework is a very specific type of evolutionary algorithm with only two individuals that are combined using path-relinking and local search. The use of path-relinking and local search in the context of evolutionary algorithms is not really new. The main contribution of the paper is the combination of these methods in a context where there are only two individuals (Master-Apprentice Evolutionary algorithm: MAE) in the population and its application to the very specific case of FJSSP. 

The paper is certainly interesting in the context of a conference on particular scheduling problems or with a strong focus on meta-heuristics but, given how sophisticated (and thus, in a certain sense, very fragile) the approach is, I'm not sure there is a strong enough generic idea underneath for a general AI conference as IJCAI.

The approach exhibits a large number of parameters (p, alpha, bta, gamma, threshold for considering two solutions as too close, number of LS iterations) and some design choices are not motivated enough (for instance, the distance measure in section 2.3, see below). As a result, it seems that the design space of the approach is so huge that indeed, by carefully tuning all these parameters, it is possible to get decent results on the benchmark. But I'm not sure it is an advantage of the approach.

Concerning the results, I think the statement in the introduction "Specifically, it improves the previous best known results for 47 instances while matching the best known results on all except 5 of the remaining instances with reasonable computational time" is wrong. When one compare to the state-of-the-art results on [1], it seems that the best solution over the 20 runs of MAE only improves 3 upper-bounds (the Dauzere instances 05a, 07a and 13a) and for 13 instances, the results are worse than the best known solutions.

The statement that "For large FJSP instances, exact methods are ineffective." should be justified. In particular, the bibliographical section completly ignores the recent advances in Constraint Programming which have shown to be particularly efficient on scheduling problems like the FJSSP, see for instance [2]. These exact methods have been used to improve both upper and lower bounds and close many of the classical instances mentioned in the present article [3].

Some more detailed comments:
- In the description of the MAE algoithm in section 2 (and Algorithm 1), the two individuals S1 and S2 do not seem to have a symmetric role: it is S1 that receives the master of the previous cycle and S2 that receives the random solution when the two solutions are too close. Maybe you should give a bit more details about it. I suspect that S2 is responsible for the introduction of some diversification in the process whereas S1 s more responsible for intensification.
- In section 2.3, the definition of the distance measurement seems very involved. In particular, it is surprising that the formula d(S1,S2)=min(P1+P2, (L1-P1)+(L2-P2)) aggregates with a "min" a term P that is the number of operations "before" a given operation and a term L-P that is a number of operations "after". I think the rationale behind this distance aggregation would deserve more details.
- It would be useful to give the algorithmic complexity of Algorithm 2.
- The selection of the candidate solutions in the path-relinking using the indexes (lines 19-23) is quite complex and looks a bit artificial (with the selection depending on the sum of two indexes that estimate very different things). It looks a bit like black magic here ...

Many thanks for your review!
The response below follows the order of the points raised in the review.
-Scheduling is a typical problem in AI. We believe that any method able to solve it is useful for AI, whether the method is metaheuristic or not.
-As many metaheuristic methods, MAE has several parameters. As Fig. 3, 4, 5 show, we just needed to try few values of the 6 parameters. Thanks to the robustness of MAE, several values of these parameters have comparably good performance.
-[1] does not specify how the world records were obtained for the FJSP instances and how much time was needed, while we clearly specified the experimental protocol and cutoff time. Compared with [1] on 313 instances, MAE obtains new records for 10 instances. Due to the importance of FJSP, many people worked hard to solve it, so breaking any world record requires a significantly new feature. We will explain this in the final version.
-We will include references of exact methods ([2] and [3]) and discuss the complementarities of heuristic and exact methods. MAE (30 min) gets better results than [2](8 hours) for 11 instances, see attached file.
-Yes, your understanding is right. In Alg. 1, S1 and S2 do not have the same role, because we wanted to inspire from the human intelligence, where the father and the mother of a family usually should have a complementary role to make their children grow well.
-We defined the distance of two solutions to reflect the minimum number of adjacent moves, in which an operation is moved one position forward or backward, needed to make the two solutions identical.
-The worst complexity of Alg. 2 is O(n^5), see attached file.
-We select the candidate solutions in the path-relinking for two contradictory goals: Improve the quality and diversity of the solutions, explaining the use of two different indexes. Other selection methods are also possible.
In the final version, we will purchase two additional pages to address the above questions, as is allowed.

This paper proposes a two-individual evolutionary algorithm, called MAE, for solving FJSPs. Experimental results demonstrate that MAE outperforms some other algorithms in terms of optimization accuracy and computational efficiency.

Major concerns:

1.      It is argued that MAE is different from either one-individual algorithms or population-based algorithms. However, it is not clear why such a property is advantageous. In other words, the motivation of this work is not quite clear. Please clarify.

2.      In Algorithm 1, a parameter p is used to control the inner cycle of the algorithm. This seems tricky. Although the learning (reproduction) process only involves two individuals each time, repeating the procedure for a couple of times will implicitly generate a population. So why is it more efficient than having a population directly? A theoretical computational complexity analysis will be helpful. A sensitivity analysis of p is also expected.

3.      Section 2.3: a unite distance between S1 and S2 is defined. What is the motivation of having such a new distance measure? Please clarify.

4.      One advantage of evolutionary algorithms is their population-based natures, which enables high concurrency in terms of fitness evaluations and reproductions. When you make comparisons, CPU time is used as the termination condition. This is not fair as different algorithms may be programmed in different manners. What if the number of fitness evaluations is used as the termination condition?

5.      Regarding the real computation time, the population based EAs may allow paralleling computing and thus have more advantages. It may not be fair to make comparisons in the way as you did to draw the conclusion that MAE is more efficient.

6.      The results obtained by MAE are very close to those obtained by GRASP-mELS. Please justify why MAE is better.


Minor issues:


Please have a careful proofreading to correct the typos.

1. The drawback of one-individual algorithms is that they have difficulty to maintain the diversity. The drawback of population-based algorithms is that they usually have to manage a large number of individuals, which is complex and time-consuming. Using two individuals allows to combine the advantages of the two worlds and to avoid their drawbacks: The two individuals in our approach have a complementary role: one is for intensification and the other for diversification. 
2. Repeating p times the reproduction of a k-individuals population generates p*k individuals. The case k=2 generates the fewest individuals. Moreover, while directly generating the p*k individuals does not allow to benefit from earlier search, producing individuals of the (i+1)-th generation from the i-th generation makes search incremental. Indeed, the quality of the individuals is usually better in the next generation. Figure 3 analyzes the sensitivity of p.
3. We defined the distance of two solutions to reflect the minimum number of adjacent moves, in which an operation is moved one position forward or backward, needed to make the two solutions identical.
4. We believe that using CPU time as termination condition allows the fairest comparison, because it is objective and independent of algorithms. The number of fitness evaluations may not allow a fair comparison, because other algorithms use time as termination condition too and did not report the number of fitness evaluations.
5. To compare with population-based EAs in parallel computing, we can run several MAE in parallel, each with a different random seed, and report the best solution found.
6. In roughly the same runtime, MAE finds better, equal and worse solutions for respectively 52, 121 and 5 instances compared with GRASP-mELS. This result is significant because GRASP-mELS is very good.
In the final version, we will purchase two additional pages to address the above questions, as is allowed.

MARIE-JO HUGUET: 8/10

This paper deals with a new method for solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). This NP-hard problem is well-known in the literature and there exist many papers as cited by the authors.

For large scale instances, metaheuritics are the main efficient methods. The authors propose to adapt an evolutionary algorithm using only two individuals, introduced in 2017 to solve graph coloring problems.

The proposed method, called MAE (master-apprentice evolutionary) algorithm, is detailed in section 2. MAE algorithm is based on several classical components: path relinking, tabu search and evolution based algorithm. The path relinking is based on a unique distance between 2 solutions that simplify its application. However, this part of the MAE algorithm may be the most time consuming and
its complexity could be more detailed in the paper. 


In section 3, experimental experiments show the interest of MAE for the FJSP. The experiments are based on standard sets of instances and compare MAE with several previously published studies. The authors show that their method is competitive and improves the state of the art for the FJSP. The impact of the MAE's parameters is also analyzed.

Some remarks :

- Section 1: for some problems, it can be interesting to explore unfeasible solutions (see for instance the Unified Tabu-Search Méthod: J-F Cordeau, G Laporte, A Mercier, A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 2001). It is not clear why it cannot lead to interesting solutions for the FJSP.

- Section 2:

* Figure 1 is not very clear and could be improved

* 2.2. A solution is represented by 2 vectors \alpha (machine assignment) and \pi (processing order); \pi could be more explicitly defined.

* An illustrative example would improve the understanding of section 2 (solution representation, distance between 2 solutions, ....)

- Section 3: Why the authors do not provide the results of others methods in Table 4 (for Hurink Data ?)

The response below follows the order of the points raised in the review.
- Algorithm 2 works in the set N of feasible solutions that can be obtained from Sc by applying a single move. The size of N is in O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the total number of operations. The most time-consuming part is the "for" loop in lines 12 - 18, where the makespan of each solution in N is estimated in O(1) and its distance to Sg is computed in O(n). The complexity of this "for" loop is O(n*|N|)=O(n^3). Note that the "for" loop in lines 19-22 just sort N two times in O(|N|*log(|N|))=O(log(n)*n^2). So the complexity of the main "while" loop is O(n^3), which is executed at most O(n^2) times. So the complexity of Algorithm 2 is O(n^5) in the worst case.
- Our difficulty in exploring unfeasible solutions is that repairing the unfeasible solutions often results in very poor solutions because it changes the related critical operations. We will include the reference [Cordeau et al. 2001] in the paper and indicate this promising research line to explore unfeasible solutions. Many thanks for your suggestion!
- We will improve Figure 1 and add an illustrative example to facilitate the understanding of Section 2 (solution representation, distance between 2 solutions) in the attached file. Our difficulty here was the lack of space. In the final version, we will purchase two additional pages to improve the presentation, as is allowed.
- We did not provide the results of other methods in Table 4 for Hurink Data because only GRASP-mELS and SSPR provide the detailed computational results for each of the instance in Hurink Data and we just know summary results of other methods from their original papers. In the final version, we will add a comparison of the summary results of MAE and the other methods, showing that the RPD values of the best and average solutions obtained by MAE are better than other methods.
- We will carefully check the references.

CAMINO RODRIGUEZ_VELA: 6/10

In this paper the authors present an evolutionary algorithm with only two individuals, named Master-Apprentice Evolutionary algorithm (MAE), to solve the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). Basically, the authors propose an evolutionary algorithm that, to avoid the foreseeable premature convergence derived from use only two individuals, integrates a Tabu Search (TS) procedure and a recombination operator based on Path Relinking (PR). The paper includes an extensive experimental study where MAE is tested on the four benchmarks widely used in the literature, that is, in 178 instances with different sizes and flexibilities.

The problem addressed in the paper is certainly a well-studied job shop problem that has been studied extensively by a variety of authors over the last decades. The authors make a summary of the literature on the problem and then use the state-of-the-art methods to compare with their approach.

Most of the components of the algorithm MAE proposed here are not new. The idea of use TS and PR in an Evolutionary Algorithm for the FJSP has been used in [González et al., 2015]. In fact, MAE uses the same coding for chromosomes. The neighbourhood structure is also borrowed from [González et al. 2015] and [Mastrolilli and Gambardella, 2000]. The estimation of makespan, that is not explained I suppose is not original either.

The original contributions are the distance measure used in PR and the main structure of the MAE. These changes allow the authors to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in most of the instances in a reasonable CPU time. Even this improvement is not too high, I think this is a substantial improvement of the best known results and so the contribution of the paper is significant.

In the following, I provide some comments and suggestions:

Could you explain what is the intuition behind the distance metric? Have you proved that it is a distance and not just a similarity measure?

I’m not sure that the comparison with ITS is the best way to show the merit of the MAE.

Are Figure 3 well labelled? It seems that something is wrong as the best makespan is worse than the average makespan.

The reference [Ángel González et al., 2013] must be referenced as [González et al. 2013] as Ángel is the second name, not the family name.

A last consideration is about the title of the paper: an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is population based. A population with two individuals is difficult that evolves. To be good, a metaheuristic doesn’t need to be evolutionary but, in this case, is not a good idea to name it “based EA”

The response below follows the order of the points raised in the review.
- Our distance metric of two solutions represents the minimum number of adjacent moves, in which an operation is moved one position forward or backward, needed to make the two solutions identical. So, it is indeed a distance between two solutions and not just a similarity measure. See attached file for the rationale of distance definition.
- In order to show the merit of MAE, we needed to compare it with k-individuals (k>2) population-based algorithms and one-individual algorithms. In Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4, we compared MAE with the state-of-the-art algorithms such SSPR, HGTS, HA which are all k-individuals (k>2) population-based algorithms. Unfortunately, we did not find any recent effective one-individual algorithm for the FJSP in the literature. So, we designed a one-individual algorithm by modifying MAE. However, the simple tabu search (TS) is not effective for the FJSP, because the search is not diversified enough in TS. That is why we designed ITS which combines TS and a perturbation procedure and compared ITS with MAE, see the figure in attached file for the comparison among MAE, TS, and ITS. Experimental results show that MAE performs better than both k-individuals (k>2) population-based algorithms and one-individual algorithms.
- We will correct the error in Figure 3 and in the reference [Gonzálezet al. 2013]. Many thanks for your careful reviewing!
- We will carefully check the references.
- We will change the title of the paper into "A Two-Individual Based Metaheuristic Algorithm for the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem". Thanks a lot for your suggestion!
