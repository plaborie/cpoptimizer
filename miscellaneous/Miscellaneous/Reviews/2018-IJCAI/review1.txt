Reviewers should recognise and reward papers that propose genuinely new ideas. As a reviewer you should try to assess whether the ideas are truly new. Novel combinations, adaptations or extensions of existing ideas are also valuable.
Technical Quality

Technical Quality 
1-10 -> 6
Are the results technically sound? Are there obvious flaws in the conceptual approach? Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Are the experiments well thought out and convincing? Will it be possible for other researchers to replicate these results? Is the evaluation appropriate? Did the authors clearly assess both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach?

Clarity and quality of writing
1-10 -> 7
Is the paper clearly written? Is there a good use of examples and figures? Is it well organized? Are there problems with style and grammar? Are there issues with typos, formatting, references, etc.? It may be better to advise the authors to revise a paper and submit to a later conference, than to accept and publish a poorly-written version. However, if the paper is likely to be accepted, please make suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper, and provide details of typos.

1-10 -> 3
Does the paper situate the work with respect to the state of the art? Are relevant papers cited, discussed, and compared to the presented work?


Overall Score
1-10 -> 3
10- This is best-paper material. 9- An excellent paper, a very strong accept. 8-A very good paper, a strong accept 7-A good paper, accept. 6-A good paper overall. I vote for acceptance, although would not be upset if it were rejected because of the low acceptance rate. 5-Decent paper, but may be below the IJCAI threshold. I tend to vote for rejecting it, although would not be upset if it were accepted. 4-I vote for rejecting it, but could be persuaded otherwise. 3-A weak paper, just not good enough. 2-A clear rejection. I vote and argue for rejection. Clearly below the standards of the conference. 1-A very strong rejection. I will actively fight for rejection.

The article is clearly written and easy to read. It proposes a meta-heuristics (discrete firefly) to solve an extension of the flexible jobshop problem (FJSSP) with suspension of tasks.

One of the weakest points of the paper, in the context of a general AI conference like IJCAI is that it treats a very specific problem (a variant of the flexible job-shop) with specific techniques that seem to be hard to generalize to other planning of scheduling problems. Here, typically, the firefly representation (described in section 3.2) heavily exploit the structure of the jobs as a chain of operations. For instance, you mention later in the article (section 4.1) the ERN MILP model that can be easily extended to non-linear route of jobs ("This is an essential constraint for the modern manufacturing, such in the modern printing industry") but it is not clear if the proposed firefly approach can easily be extended to this type of constraint. 

The comparison with the literature is missing an important part about Constraint Programming (CP) which can be considered as the state-of-the-art exact method for solving the flexible jobshop problem. In [1] for instance, many well known FJSSP instances were closed (including some of the Brandimarte instances mentioned on Table 4) using a very simple CP formulation of the problem. In fact, all the instances on Table 4 are closed except for the last one (Mk10). It is difficult to assess the performance of the proposed firefly approach on these problems as most of them are very easy and very small. But on the two hardest ones (Mk06 and Mk10), one sees that the firefly approach does not find the optimal solution. It is surprising that you compared with several MILP models using CPLEX 12.7 but did not even consider using the CP Optimizer solver (also available in CPLEX Optimization Studio that you are using) to perform a comparison on CP. 

Note that a more or less up to date status of the different classical FJSSP instances is available here: http://www.quintiq.com/optimization/flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem-results.html

Furthermore, the proposed extension with "crossable unavailable periods and resumable operations" is a very common feature in scheduling and it can be easily formulated in CP so I think the proposed approach should be compared against a simple CP Optimizer model as the one I attach at the end of the review.

Some more detailed comments:
- Section 3.1. "As it is often faster to calculate 1/(1+r^2) than an exponential function" : is it really computed so often that this approximation pays off ?
- Section 3.5. The "attraction" mechanism in the firefly heuristic really ressembles the "path relinking" idea that is often used in GRASP heuristics. Is there any difference?
