The article describes a CP model for the multiple-TSP problem. This CP model is based on interval and sequence variables available in CP Optimizer. The model is quite straightforward but its performance looks good when compared to other approaches on some classical instances.

One of the main problem with the paper is that the format really looks messy. Here are some example that should be improved:
* Some notations should be homegeneized: sometimes j denotes a city, in other circunstances, a salesman
* Sometimes, there are unclear sentences, for instance on top of page 6: "x_ij [...] represents the ith city visited by the jth salesman": one may understand that x_ij is the ith city in the route of the salesman, in the sense that it is the city at position i. You should better say that interval variable x_ij represents the possibility for the salesman j to visit city i. You should also say somewhere that the size of these intervals is 0 (null duration visits allow formulating the objective function as the sum of the end time of the routes).
* Some citations are really weird, for instance [36], I really do not see the point of this citation
* The CP model is described only part by part, it would be good to present the full CP model in a figure/table. In particular, the paper introduces the expressions typeOfNext but I do not think these expressions are used in the model
* The results in the experimental section are really difficult to read. One of the reasons is that the numbers are often splitted on several lines (e.g. tables 3, 7). These tables should be improved so as to look better and be more readable. Also, I'm not sure that tables 1 and 2 are useful as their main result is recapped on the tables of section 5.
* There probably is a typo in the CP model as I find it strange that the same interval variable x_1j is at the same time 'first' and 'last' in the sequence. I suppose the 'last' interval is an interval variable different of x_1j that represents the return of the salesman to the depot.

In the description of the ILP model in section 2, it would be good to mention that the introduction of the position variables u_i make it possible to avoid the classical subtour elimination constraints. 

The general description of CP in section 3 is a bit too general and I find it does not fully reflect the current state of CP. In particular, it may make the reader believe that CP is only constraint propagation techniques and tree search. In fact many other techniques are used in addition to these, and it is these additional techniques that are probably responsible for the good results because, I guess, a plain tree search would not give any good results. So, in the case of CP Optimizer, I suppose that optimality proofs are provided by the Failure-Directed search [1] whereas good quality solutions are produced by the Large Neighborhood Search [2], these 2 techniques are combined in the CP Optimizer automatic search.

A few more detailed comments:

- p3, section 2: "For any traveler ..." I think you should speak of "salesman" instead of "traveler" here, not to confuse the reader

- p3, section 2: just below: "In addition let K be the minimum number of nodes ..., if x_ij=1 then K <= u_i <= L must be satisfied". I think that this statement is wrong: K <= u_i is of course too strong. May be you mean if x_i1=1 ?

- p4, section 3: "CP ... utilize heuristics, such as consistency techniques, constraint propagation and branch and prune" I would not call them 'heuristics' but 'techniques'

- p5, section 3: "If all variables are instantiated and a constraint is not satisfied, then a search phase continues". I do not understand this sentence.

- p5, section 3.1: citation 36 is really weird and has nothing to do with interval variables

- p5, section 3.1: just below: probably a missing "." after "one can decide not to consider them in the solution schedule"
