The article is about the resolution of a classical scheduling problem (Multi-skill project scehduling) using CP techniques so it is completely relevant to the scope of the conference.

The paper proposes some CP models for the Multi-skill project scheduling problem, and analyze their performance on existing benchmarks when solved with a Lazy Clause Generation CP solver.

The proposed CP models are rather straightforward, except for the quite unconventional decomposition of the global disjunctive constraint into a set of individual pariwise disjunctions, which is justified by a better exploitation of these individual constraints by LCG. 

The experimental section shows that the proposed approach clearly improves on the state-of-the-art on the existing benchmarks.

The paper is clearly written. 

It does not seem to be easy to find the instances of the benchmarks used in the experimental section. In particular, it is not clear where the instances of type (2) come from, as you only mention "[14] selected a subset of 271 instances from the available 278 MSPSP instances in set 2". It would be really nice to point to those instances in the paper.

In the experimental section, the results focus on the optimality proofs. What about the quality of the solution for the instances that could not be solved to optimality? It would be good to have an idea of both the lower and the upper bounds for the open instances.

The quadratic number of disjunctive constraints introduced to make clause learning more efficient clearly seems to be a limitation of the approach. In particular, do you think the approach would scale well for finding good quality solutions (maybe without optimality proofs) for larger problems ?
