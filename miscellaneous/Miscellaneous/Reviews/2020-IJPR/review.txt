*Comments to the Author

The article is on a very interesting and challenging topic. And I think the idea to use CP techniques to solve this problem is a very good one. Unfortunately, the manuscript is very difficult to read because the definition of the problem is not clear. In particular, one of the main constraints of the problem (the relations expressed in the if-then rules) should be described in a more formal way. The presentation of the CP model is also not clear and it seems that it could benefit from some improvements. More details below.

In the description of the AND/OR graph and rules of the figures, the conventions are not cleat at all. On Fig 1(a), it seems the number inside the vertices denote the "serial number" (the serial number of what? of the product ? I thought that the precedence graph is about making a given product?). Then in figure 1(b), the label inside the nodes is prefixed by "C". Is "C1" a similar thing as "1". Then, in Fig 2, what is used inside the nodes is a decimal number like 1,1 (is it the duration?) and there is an integer outside the node (is it the identifier of the task?). Please use the same conventions everywhere. Also the red circular arcs are really ugly and furthermore they are opaque. 

You say that "... Table 1, which is a summary language description table of basic precedence, shows that the If-then rules has the advantage of being descriptive, concise, and efficient for the description of the constraints for assembly lines when compared to precedence graph and AOG.". On the table, I do not see the advantage of the If-then rules compared to the AND-OR graph. It seems to me it is just a textual description of the hyper-arcs of the AND-OR graph, I do not see why it is more "concise". If a claim of the article is that the if-then rule representation is more compact that the AND-OR graph one, this should be formally proved.

There is something not clear in the illustrative example, and it raises some doubt about the purpose of the complete paper. In the illustrative example, it seems that you want to schedule the assembly of 3 types of bikes. The general process for assembling a bike is described by and ANR/OR graph (or if-then rules) as described on Table 2. But if I understand well the illustrative example, for a given type of bike (say type 1), the process for assembling it is no more an AND/OR graph but a simple precedence graph. For product of type 1, it will be something like: 1.1 -> 3.1, 2.1 ->3.1, 3.1->4.1, 4.1->6.1. So "which" tasks are used is decided by the type of product before solving the problem. This is something that is not clear at all in the general description of the paper because one could think that the "OR" condition hold on the "existence" of the tasks rather than on the temporal constraints. Stated otherwise, what is the exact semantics of (if TA OR TB THEN TH) expressed both on the existence of the tasks and their temporal relationship? My understanding from the example seems to be: if Ta or TB exists (but this is not a decision of the model, this is something known in advance in the problem), then TH necessarily exists and it starts after the end of at least one of the existing tasks Ta or Tb. As for instance in the illustrative example, for product 1, all tasks 1,1 and 2,1 and 3,1 are present and in the solution depicted on the left of Fig 3, task 3.1 is executed after 1,1 but before 2,1.

Comments on the CP Optimizer model:

In the description of the modeling concepts: the 'span' constraint has nothing to do with 'sequence variables' so it should not belong to a section called "sequence variables"

The description of the decision variables is not clear. What is their type (integer variable, interval variable) ?
I suppose that x_j is an integer variable, \alpha_sj and \beta_sp are interval variables. What about P(r) the "predecessor of task "r" ?". It seems to be a set as it is iterated, for instance in equation (31). What is this decision variable P(r) ? Also y_jt is a decision variable used in the model but it is not declared in section 4.2.

Also, the equations in the model are missing many universal quantifiers on the right side. For example on constraint (31) there should be a \forall s. These omissions make the model very difficult to read.

The CP Optimizer formulation described in section 4.3. do not really exploit the modeling concepts of CP Optimizer for scheduling. I think a simpler model exists that would be more efficient than the proposed CP model. The proposed CP model creates many composite constraints involving disjunctions ("OR" like in constraints 32,33,34,35, by the way, I think the notion "\cup" for OR is really not common, I think you should better use the logical OR and AND operator notations for that: "\lor", "\land"):
- If you want to reason on the existence or absence of the tasks (if it is part of the decisions of the model, but this is not clear), the classical way to model AND/OR graphs in CP Optimizer is through the use of "span" and "alternative" constraints. 
- And for the case of disjunctions on precedence constraints like (A or B) before C, instead of posting it as a disjunction (A before C) || (B before C), like in equation 32, it would be more efficient to post a constraint like min(endOf(A),endOf(B)) <= startOf(C). The reason is that in CP it is always stronger to "factorize" the variables in the constraints. Similar thing for the other constraints, for instance for (A or B) before (C or D) it would be something like min(endOf(A),endOf(B)) <= max(startOf(C),startOf(D)). 
- Also, it seems that the model is missing some precedence constraints: currently temporal constraints are posted only on intervals of the same stations (for all s: post precedence on operations if executed on station 's'). But no temporal constraint is posted between different stations. If you have, for a given product (A or B) before C, if A and B are executed on station 1 and C on station 2, no constraint seem to be posted on the start time of C. I think that you should create additional (present) interval variables \gamma_j representing the operations j and post alternative constraints alternative(\gamma_j, [\alpha_sj for s in S]) and post the temporal constraints directly on the \gamma_j

Section 4: "ILOG Scheduler": you should avoid using different names for the same tool : the tools you are using is "CP Optimizer", or the full name "IBM ILOG CP Optimizer" ("ILOG Scheduler" is the name of an old tool that is not supported any more).

As you created some artificial instances for the experiments, I think that it would be really useful to make them publicly available. It would also be useful to make the MILP and CP models available if possible.
