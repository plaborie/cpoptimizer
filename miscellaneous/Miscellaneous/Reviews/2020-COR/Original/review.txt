Reviewer Blind Comments to Author

The authors improved a lot the manuscript since their original version and I think the current version should be accepted for publication.

I have mainly some minor comments that would help improving the current version of the submission.

* First, I think that the authors should better highlight the fact that the CP approach proposed in the paper is an *exact algorithm* that, beside producing good solutions, also provides lower bounds and optimality proofs. This is something that the meta-heuristic approaches are not able to do.

* In section 4, you say that "The CP Optimizer uses the newest iterative diving search method to perform aggressive dives in the search tree without backtrack [4]. Other settings are default." 

Did you really change some settings to only use this new Iterative Diving search (typically SearchType="IterativeDiving") ? Or did you use the default settings that use this new type of search as "one" of the ingredients of the search ? 

Also, I think that here, citation [4] is wrong.

* In the model formulation, I think that it would be very interesting to try a variant of the current formulation that introduces 'alternative' constraints for the 'OR' nodes (both initiators and terminators). It would lead to stronger constraint propagation in the engine (because it would consider the conjunction of the startBeforeEnd (constraints 6) and constraints on the presence (constraints 10) instead of considerating them separately) and would probably improve the performance and the capability to provide optimality proofs. 

Concretely, suppose an OR node a -> OR {b,c}, it would mean creating two additional optional interval variables a_b and a_c, post an alternative(a, {a_b,a_c}) and post precedences and presence constraints on these intervals: endBeforeStart(a_b,b); presenceOf(a_b)==presenceOf(b); endBeforeStart(a_c,c); presenceOf(a_c)==presenceOf(c). A similar formulation can be adopted for OR-terminator nodes. With this model for instance, the naive lower bound consisting of the shortest operation durations and the shortest length of "OR" sub-processes would be naturally found by constraint propagation at the root node. Which is probably not the case with the current formulation.

Please note that your recommendation and reviewer report are expected to cover the Highlights and Graphical Abstract if submitted with the manuscript.

Please give a frank account of the strengths and weaknesses of the article:

Strengths:
- The problem is interesting, challenging and clearly relevant to the journal topics of interest.
- The approach that is used is an exact approach that produces very good results, as shown in the experimental section.

Weaknesses:
 - The translation of the problem into a CP Optimizer model is quite straightforward (though I think it worth being published because this type of approach is mostly overlooked by the OR community who mostly think: exact approach => MIP model)
