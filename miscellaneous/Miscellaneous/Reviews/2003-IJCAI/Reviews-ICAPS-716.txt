The  authors do  a good  job of taking  results  from discrete control
theory and  mapping  them  into  the  domain  of planning.   The paper
provides a very  interesting and unusual  perspective on planning that
is valuable for the community.  Furthermore, the authors have provided
an interesting contribution to  the  theory of discrete  combinatorial
search. An organizational  weakness of the  paper is that considerable
effort is spent on the mathematics of CLM and DSP  at the expense of a
more in-depth view on the integration with ASPEN. Some of the features
of DCV CSA are  not used in the  integrated algorithm, and some of the
theoretical power seems unecessary in the integrated algorithm because
of ASPEN`s approach  to planning. Given  the focus of this conference,
the  authors might consider  revising the  final version to  emphasize
only the most  relevant parts of the theory,  and concentrate more  on
the integration with ASPEN.  I have one  other technical  comment. The
functional form of  F limits the reward function  to include a pair of
timepoints.   This  excludes  "general"   rewards similar to "general"
constraints, and ensures that the principle of optimality applies. One
question concerning  the presentation: the  math is somewhat involved,
and the authors do  not really give an intuitive  feeling for what the
math says. One way  of viewing the result is  this: in a time-variable
dynamical  system lacking  constraints  that  are temporally  extended
(referred  to as "general  or global constraints  in the paper) divide
and    conquer  algorithms can  be  used  to  find   good solutions by
exploiting   the fact that optimal  solutions   to sub-problems can be
stitched together to create optimal solutions to  the whole problem. A
final comment on the results: no indication of  CPU overhead from your
scheme is indicated. While the technique appears to be lightweight and
probably does not contribute significantly, it would be useful to have
a quantitative assessment of the overhead in the final presentation.

Summary:
--------
The authors  extend  the theory of  controlling time-varying dynamical
systems to enhance planning algorithms. They  first show how to extend
methods of finding optimal evolutions of dynamical systems to discrete
systems. They  then show how to  modify planners that  operate on such
discrete  spaces using their  techniques.   They demonstrate that  the
resulting system provides better plans than the original planner.

The  paper proposes to model  planning probleems  with discrete states
and discrete time as dynamic  optimization problems, and developes new
node-dominance  relations    to   improve  the     solution   of  such
problems.  This is  done  via  the use  of  Lagrangian  multipliers in
discrete space. The new  node-dominance relations lower the  bounds in
the formula of the computational complexity. They also seem to improve
the computation  practically, as shown  by the experimental results. I
suggest  the authors to add  one or more  examples, to help the reader
understand the proposed techniques and also their usage.

I am not very familiar with Lagrangian multipliers, but the work seems
interesting and convenient. I cannot judge on the originality though.

The  application of discrete  nonlinear  programming ideas to planning
and  scheduling really  sounds   to be  a   good  idea. I`m  not  very
knowledgeable in this domain but I found the first (and actually main)
part of the paper is written  very clearly; only explaining the models
and the main results, leaving aside all the unnecessary details.

In fact, I think  that the weak point of  the paper is the description
of the   experimental   study on  ASPEN. It    would  have  been  very
interesting to describe  much more in details  the model: what kind of
local, lagragian and  global constraints are  considered; what  is the
shape of the  objective function,  etc...  In  other words,  the  link
between  the model and  the algorithms proposed in  the first part and
the ASPEN experiments are clearly lacking.

It is mentioned in the experimental results  that ASPEN DCV CSA allows
to find bundles of the same quality  some orders faster than ASPEN. On
the curves, only the number of iterations is mentionned.I suppose that
there is on overhead due to DCV CSA,  in terms of computation time for
each   iteration.  From this  point   of view  it  may have  been more
realistic to show on the  curves CPU times instead   of the number  of
iterations on the x-axis.

On  page 2, column  2, begining of second paragraph,  I think that one
should  read  "The class  of discrete-time,  mixed-state problems ..."
instead of "continous-time".

Summary:
--------
The application of  discrete  nonlinear programming ideas  to planning
and scheduling is, as  far as I know,  original. The framework and the
underlying algorithms are  interesting, well described  and seem to be
promising. More details  should be given  about the application of the
approach to the ASPEN planning and scheduling problem otherwise, it is
very hard to have an idea of the interest of the approach.
