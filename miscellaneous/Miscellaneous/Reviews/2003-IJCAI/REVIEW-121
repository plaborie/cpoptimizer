This paper represents a significant amount of work and gives some very
interesting  results.  Furthermore,   it  is  beautifully  written and
organized.

Identifying some tractable  fragments  of  the soft-CSP  framework  is
indeed something very  important. It helps,  of course, to  solve some
particular problems that can be directly captured by this fragment but
also, and  this  is certainly  more  useful, it allows  to  solve more
efficiently some complex problems for which  a suitable relaxation can
be expressed in the tractable fragment.

I have few comments on the content of the paper (everything is clearly
described) but on the perspectives  of this work. A section describing
the issues  and  possible extensions would  indeed be  necessary.  For
example, what about the problem of recognizing  whether a given binary
evaluation function is   submodular  or not ?    And, in  case  it  is
submodular, what about  the complexity of computing  its decomposition
(or the decomposition of a close  enough submodular function that is a
lower bound to the original evaluation function)  ?  Are there ways to
reduce the size of the graph on which the  minimum cut is computed (nb
variables * size of domains) ? What  about the practical applicability
of the minimal cut algorithm ? Could part of  the results presented in
this paper be extended to n-ary soft constraints ?












The paper  describes   a   maximal tractable  class  of    soft binary
constraints: the  ones  for which the  evaluation  of each constraints
corresponds   to a  binary submodular   function.   In this  case, the
evaluations  functions can  be  expressed  as  a  sum of   generalized
interval functions and the problem can be solved as a minimum weighted
cut on a directed graph.  Proofs  of tractability and  of the fact the
language  is maximally  tractable  are sketched.  several examples are
provided.
