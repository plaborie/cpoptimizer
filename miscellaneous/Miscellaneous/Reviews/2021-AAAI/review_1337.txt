The paper is very difficult to read because it is lacking a crisp and formal description of the problem. Decision variables of the problem are never formally introduced:
- do we want to find a start time for the different jobs? what is the time granularity ... days, shifts, more precise?)
- how do the job express their requirement in terms of manpower ?
Overall, it seems that the problem is a fairly classical manpower scheduling problem.

The proposed GA is also missing many details so that it is not possible to understand its main principles.

The experiments are only performed on what seems to be a very small problem.


11. [Detailed Comments] Please provide other detailed comments and constructive feedback. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

I think the paper should start with a complete and formal description of the problem.
In particular, what are the decision variables of the problem and what are the possible values for these variables.

The notations are particularly hard to understand.

For example: "We define the arbitrary jobs set K contains jobs that encoded as (1; 2; 3; ...; k).
For arbitrary job position K_j , to determine whether the employee i is on duty that day,
the employee of corresponding position can be coded as impact function \delta^{Kj}_i".

What is the position K_j of a job ? Is it not just the index "j" ?
Also "whether the employee i is on duty that day": which day ?
Do you have a variable in your model defining the day of a job ? Then you should explicitely describe this variable.

Also, there are some constraints \phi_{k_i}. Does the "k" here refer to some jobs ? It seems that not and it is very misleading.

"... which indicates that for employee i in any position K" What is the "position" of an employee ? In your notations, K denotes the set of all jobs ...

In section 4.1, you mention "optimal solutions". How do you prove that some solutions are optimal ?

In the experiments, the proposed approach seems to be compared with an Integer Programming model.
The IP model seems to be faster than the GA so I guess it stopped with a solution that was proved to be optimal.
In this case, how can it be that the "accuracy" of IP is only of 70% ? That do not really make sense.

Q1: What are the different decision variables of the problem and their domain ?

Q2: What do you mean by "optimal" solution in the experimental section ? How do you prove optimality of solutions ? Are you experimenting with a single problem instance ? What is the number of tasks in the problem ?
