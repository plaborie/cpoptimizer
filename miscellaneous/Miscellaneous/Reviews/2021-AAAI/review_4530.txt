The paper proposes a new surrogate model for blackbox optimization problems involving both continuous and discrete variables. 
This surrogate model is designed in such a way that (1) its local optima are guarantee to satisfy the integrality constraint of the integer variables and (2) its size is constant and does not grow with the number of evaluation of the blackbox function.
The paper provides a proof of property (1). An experimental study is performed showing that the proposed surrogate model is competitive with existing approaches on some real-life benchmarks and scales better on some synthetic problems.

9. [Reasons to Accept] Please describe the paper’s key strengths. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)
 
- The paper is clearly written and the proposed approach well motivated
- To the best of my knowledge, the approach is original
- The experimental section suggests that the approach is competitive with other approaches on real life examples and scales better on some synthetic examples
 
10. [Reasons to Reject] Please describe the paper’s key weaknesses. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)
 
- It is difficult to assess the actual flexibility of the surrogate model. Given the particular properties of the basis function (both the integer z-functions that seem to rely on the order of the parameters as it only deals with x_i-x_{i-1}, and the particular constraints posted on the mixed z-functions), it seems to me it could be possible to find blackbox functions that cannot be efficiently fitted by this type of surrogate model. It would be interesting to have some ideas about the type of blackbox function for which the proposed surrogate model would not work well.
 
 
11. [Detailed Comments] Please provide other detailed comments and constructive feedback. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

Given the particular properties of the basis functions (the integer z-functions seem to rely on the order of the parameters as it only deals with x_i-x_{i-1}, and the particular constraints posted on the mixed z-functions), it seems to me it could be possible to find blackbox functions that cannot be efficiently fitted by this type of surrogate model.

For instance, one can understand that the proposed surrogate model is well adapted for the Rosenbrock function as the function is something like:
sum f(x_i,x_{i-1}) + sum g(x_i). This may explain the very good results of MVRSM reported on Fig. 5. I'm wondering if the approach would produce the same result using a random permutation of the input parameters x_i (Question 2).
 
 
12. [QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] Please provide questions for authors to address during the author feedback period. (Please number them) *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

Q1: Given the particular properties of the basis functions (both the integer ones and the mixed ones), do you have an idea of the blackbox functions that could be hard to approximate with the proposed MVRSM approach?

Q2: Do you think the good performance of MVRSM on Rosenbrock functions can be explained by the particular formulation of these functions that "easily" maps the basis functions of MVRSM on consecutive parameters (x_i,x_{i-1}) ?

 I'm not an expert in blackbox optimization and surrogate functions. So my appreciation concerning the originality of this work should be considered carefully. To the best of my knowledge this work is original, but my knowledge of the domain is thin ...
