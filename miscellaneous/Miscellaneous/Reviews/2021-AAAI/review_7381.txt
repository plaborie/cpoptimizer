REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. [Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words. (Do not provide any review in this box)
*   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

The paper provides a fairly complete parameterized complexity analysis of a particular
single-machine scheduling problem with material consumption.

The first two theorems establish the hardness of some of the most general problems
in this framework, whereas parameterized tractability of some other fragments is analyzed
in the sequel of the paper.

9. [Reasons to Accept] Please describe the paper’s key strengths. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

- The problem is interesting, even if very specific

- The paper appears to be technically sound


10. [Reasons to Reject] Please describe the paper’s key weaknesses. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

- Due to the specificity of the problem, I'm wondering if AAAI a good conference for it.
  I think the paper would better fit conferences that are more specialized in scheduling (INFORMS,MAPSP).

- I find that the complexity analysis do not really help solving this problem in practice:
  * Some results with reasonable complexity only apply in very specific cases (e.g. weak order of the dominance relation)
  * Some approaches are probably really too complex to be used in practice (e.g. the one of Theorem 4)

11. [Detailed Comments] Please provide other detailed comments and constructive feedback. *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

While the paper is in general clearly written, I think that a figure would help in Theorem 1 to illustrate the
Material Consumption Scheduling Problem built from the Unary Bin Packing instance.
If some space needs to be freed, it seems to me the sections about "Indentifying Structured Solutions"
and "Applying Structured Solutions" could be made shorter because these things are pretty intuitive.

In the section about related work, the acronyms PTAS and FPTAS should be explained when first introduced.

On lines 208-209: f(p) is mentioned but not used, I suppose one should read O(f(p)).


12. [QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] Please provide questions for authors to address during the author feedback period. (Please number them) *   (visible to authors during feedback, visible to authors after notification, visible to other reviewers, visible to meta-reviewers)

Q1: Given your understanding of the different sources of complexity for the MCS problem,
if you were to solve a particular instance of the general problem (with a single resource), what type of
practical algorithm would you propose ?
