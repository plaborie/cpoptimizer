>> RELEVANCE TO CONFERENCE

The paper builds on previous work on Resource Envelope (RE)
computation (that aims at computing exact resource bounds for each
date) and Balance Constraint (that aims at inferring new time bounds
and precedence relations) in the context of discrete reservoir
scheduling. It is clearly relevant to CP-AI-OR.

The contribution of the paper is an extension of Kumar's incremental
RE computation in order to perform constraint propagation.

To the best of my knowledge and in fact, quite surprisingly, it is the
first time REs are used for constraint propagation: they are usually
used for detecting dead ends, reservoir safeness of for guiding the
search heuristics. The proposed constraint propagation algorithm is
original. It is tightly integrated with the incremental RE computation
and allows detecting new time-bounds and new precedence relations,
similarly to what is done in the Balance Constraint.

The contribution of the paper is more on a practical point of view
rather than on a purely theoretical one. It deals with how to use the
information provided by the existing incremental max flow earlier so
as to perform constraint propagation rather than just checks in order
to improve efficiency. The theoretical concepts (conflicts sets, flow
graph) are the same as earlier works. 

In this context, one of the weakness of the paper is that it does not
provide enough evidence of the practical interest of the additional
constraint propagation: 
- no algorithmic complexity study is provided (one can guess the
  incremental flow dominates and it may have to be run many times before
  a fixed point is reached ...)
- the experimental study should include a part about how the
  performance scales with the problem size. Only the small 20-tasks
  instances of Neumann&Schwindt are used, what about the figures for the
  larger problems with 50 or 100 tasks of this benchmark?

The paper is technically correct. In fact most of the paper until the
end of section 3.3 is a recap of the RE computation proposed in
earlier works by Muscettola and Kumar. The contribution of this work
is described at the end of section 3.3. I think it should be more
highlighted and would deserve a specific section.

It is not clear how temporal constraints are propagated. Is a
Bellman-Ford (or a Floyd-Warshall) algorithm run from scratch at each
node and each time a (set of) new time-bounds / precedence relations
is inferred? Or do you have something more incremental? This point is
important because even if for a problem with a single reservoir, the
complexity is dominated by the max-flow algorithm (here, the max-flow
and the Bellman-Ford work on networks of similar size), when the
problem involves many reservoirs, the number of events on each
reservoir may be reasonably small whereas the total number of
time-points in the global temporal network will be very large. That's
why, from a practical point of view, reducing the problem to the one
on a single reservoir may hide some issues.

In the section about future work, the idea of adapting the max flow
approach to compute tighter levels than the ones of the Balance
Constraint already has been explored. I think you should at least
cite:

Jeremy Frank. Bounding the Resource Availability of Partially Ordered
Events with Constant Resource Impact. Proc. CP-2004.

Some more detailed comments:

- In Corollary 1 it is not evident that the difference with what is
above is that here we speak of "MINIMAL" size-2 conflicts instead of
"ANY" size-2 conflict. Maybe in "constitute a minimal size-2 conflict",
"minimal" should appear in bold.

- p3, "A consumption event c ... to aN production event

- p4, after definition 3, I find the sentence "Further, it should be
  noted that ..." a bit misleading. The section is about defining the
  semantics of the reservoir constraint whereas this remark seems to be
  more about how this constraint is propagated.

- p13, in the description of the pruning on top f the page, I think
  there is a typo, on should read g(t)-q_{max} instead of g(t)+q_{max}
  for detecting new upper bounds for dates of x in P_g.

- In the same paragraph, two lines below "... is possible: The
  minimal".

REMARKS FOR THE PROGRAMME COMMITTEE: --- If you wish to add any
remarks for PC members, please write --- them below. These remarks
will only be used during the PC --- meeting. They will not be sent to
the authors. This field is --- optional.

The constraint propagation presented in the paper is original. Even if
the paper has several weaknesses, I (weakly) propose to accept it in
order to encourage work in this direction.
