It isdifficult for a non-expert in the aviation domain to evaluate theadequation of the proposed model but it really seems a significantcontribution. In light of this risk model, the section about path planning is a bitfrustrating because, in the current state of the work, it seems onlyto deal with distances and hard obstacles. But I understand that thepresent paper is just a starting point.I'm a bit surprised by the use of a variant of A* for solving thisproblem. In the context of the emergency landing planning, one canexpect that the time to compute a solution is critical. But A* won'tprovide any solution until it has finished its exploration of thesearch space. Isn't it an issue? Wouldn't the application advocate foralso using approaches that are able to quickly provide some solutions(even if not very good) and then improve on them (such as localsearch, evolutionary approaches, etc.) ? It would be useful to have anidea of the typical size of the graph that is being considered (is theexample described on figure 3 and 4 representative of the actualproblem size?). Otherwise, the HA* algorithm in itself really isinteresting.In the approach, several options are proposed to the pilot, not onlythe 'best' one. How are they computed? By continuing the explorationof the search space of the HA* algorithm ? Because of the numerousapproximations in the model (this is hard to avoid given the hugenumber of parameters) these solutions may be all biased in the samedirection so I have the feeling there may be some issues of lack ofdiversity of the solutions presented to the pilot.There may be several paths to the same landing site with differentranking (depending if and how obstacles are traversed or bypassed). Sodepending on the actual path that is being used, only ranking thelanding sites may not be sufficient. Is there some plans to improvethe information presented to the pilot?Some more detailed comments:p4, col1: I do not understand how the value of .59/nm iscomputed. Could you explain?p4, col2: there is probably a typo in the paragraph about visibilityrisk, one read: "We therefore take the probability of loss due toceiling as", I think one should read "visibility" instead of "ceiling"here.p5, col1: for runway risk, I guess the risk=1 starts even with arunway length strictly positive. Similar with the ceiling andvisibility risks, can't we assume that there is a value (>0) for therunway length such that any length lower than this value incurs arisk=1 ?p5, col2: I do not understand footnote 8 and how the aircraft dynamicsand turn radius can be used to expand the size of each obstacle. Itwould be good to elaborate a little bit on this point or to give areference.p6: the description of the construction of the extended tangent graphis not very clear even if the notion of tunnels is quite intuitive andallows understanding the graph presented on the right side of figure3. Maybe it would help to show the secondary vertices and edges onfigure 4.p8, col1: it is not clearly said in the text which heuristic iscurrently used in the HA* algorithm although one can see in Algorithm1 that is is just an euclidean distance to the goal. p8, col1: it is mentioned that "The hardest part is to find anefficient heuristic when costs no longer have Euclidean structure". Itis not clear if this part was done or is part of future work.Note also that these links did not work when I tried them:http://www.atmos/albany.edu/weather/data1/surface/rad (page not found)http://faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications (network timeout)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS (for committee only)In fact, I'm hesitating between suggesting a full or a brief plenarypresentation for this paper. From one hand, this work is not reallymature, from the other hand, this is the type of work that should beencouraged and a workshop like SPARK is the good place for that.Do you think that this paper may represent a seed for a journal paper?YES [ ]    NO [X]Additional Comments:=============================================================================
