It ismentioned in the Tabu search section that "previously scheduled jobsare not considered by EG-EDF when building the new schedule". Does itmean that their start and end date are not changed? I thought that theEDF policy was rescheduling all jobs on the machine following anearlier deadline first strategy.Furthermore, the notion of gap is not described precisely. I suppose agap should maintain the number of currently available CPUs of themachine greater (by the way, the text in the paper says "lower") thanthe number of CPUs requested by the job for at least the duration ofthe job on the machine (otherwise, some jobs scheduled after the gapwill have to be delayed).The use of makespan in the acceptance criterion is strange. If theobjective is to maximize the machine usage, why not directly measureit on the solution (sum of the products jobDuration*requiredNbCPUs onthe machine divided by energy provided by the machine:NbCPUs*(makespan-currentTime))? This quantity can easily be maintainedincrementally. That would allow to recognize situations where EGincreases machine usage (as it schedules an additional job on themachine) whereas it does not change the makespan.It is surprising that, in the Tabu search, the last jobs of themachine are selected, independently from the fact they are late (withrespect to their deadline) or not. Wouldn't it make more sense toselect only the late jobs ?It would be very valuable to have a complexity analysis of thealgorithms, both for EG-EDF and for the Tabu search.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS (for committee only)Do you think that this paper may represent a seed for a journal paper?YES [ ]    NO [X]Additional Comments:=============================================================================
