*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

The main interest of the paper is to show that depth-first search with storage of expanded nodes 
can be efficient for solving scheduling problems of reasonable size (here up to about 100 operations) 
and complexity (jobshop problem extended with operator constraints and total flow time objective function).
The paper shows that the main reason for this efficiency is the pruning performed by the proposed dominance rule. 

Even in the case the full search tree cannot be traversed, the approach provides solutions of quite good quality. 
It would be interesting to see how this scales with even larger problems for instance until some 20x20 instances.

I did not find in the paper how the successor of a given state was selected among the candidate set B 
(see end of section 4.1). I suppose the search selects first the operation in B with the smallest end time, 
is that right?

The computation of the second heuristic h_{OP} is difficult to follow. Probably an example and/or a figure would help. 
Being more formal about the proof this actually defines a lower-bound would be useful too.

In the dominance rule section, I'm wondering if there is not a typo in condition (3). Is it really av(s1)>=av(s2) 
and not av(s1)<=av(s2) ? Intuitively, s1 will rather be better than s2 if the operators become available sooner in s1.

In conclusion I think the paper is a good paper to be discussed at RCRA 2012. It provides interesting extensions to 
some known approaches and a convincing experimental evaluation.
