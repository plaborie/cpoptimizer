The paper describes an application of Scatter Search and Path Relinking to the problem of job-shop scheduling with non-anticipatory setup times. The main contribution of the paper is a new neighborhood structure that exploits the particular nature of non-anticipatory setup times. An experimental evaluation clearly shows the efficiency of the approach that outperforms the current state-of-the-art for this scheduling problem.

In general, the paper is clearly written and the use of figures really helps the comprehension when needed.

I think the paper could be improved by providing more details on the following points:

- the practical interest of non-anticipatory transition times should be better motivated in the introduction. 

- the proposed neighborhood structure is shown to contain all the improving neighbors reachable by reversing single disjunctive arcs. Do we have some general property on the reachability of an optimal solution using this structure? It seems clear that only following improving path can lead to local optima and that explains the use of the tabu search ingredient in the approach but can we prove that with the proposed approach, including TS, there always exist a path to an optimal solution?

- often in practical applications, the sequence-dependent setup times satisfy the triangle inequality otherwise it would be advantageous to introduce a fake operation in between two successive operations (u,v) on the same machine to reduce the transition time between u and v. Considering setup times that do not satisfy the triangle inequality is one of the reasons why reversing some non-critical arcs can produce immediate improvement as illustrated in the example of Figure 2 (for the case of anticipatory transition times). Do you think that adding the restriction that setup times should satisfy the triangle inequality (reasonable assumption in practice) would help improving the neighborhood structure with stronger feasibility or non-improving conditions?
