-------------------------------------------
Detailed comments to authors:

I reviewed the initial version of the paper (reviewer 2) and had, at that time, several suggestions to improve/clarify the paper. All those suggestions are thoroughly addressed in the present version so I have not much to add. The article tackles a significant problem in scheduling, proposes a meta-heuristic approach that is carefully motivated in light of the problem being solved and of the literature. The approach is clearly described and the experimental study is convincing. I recommend to accept the article.
