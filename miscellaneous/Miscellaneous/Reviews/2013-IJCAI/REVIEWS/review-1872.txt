Comments to author(s)
---------------------

The paper describes a set of algorithms for optimizing buffers in the automatic implementation of a real time system model. 
These algorithms are evaluated in last section of the paper.

This work mostly belongs to the field of real-time systems implementation. As far as I know, there have not been so many papers on real-time systems in past IJCAI conferences but the topic is in the list of IJCAI 2013 keywords (Multidisciplinary Topics And Applications > Real-Time Systems). I'm surprised this keyword was not used to qualify the paper. 

I must say that I'm not an expert in real-time systems, this is reflected in my low confidence rating above and all my comments below should be understood with this in mind. 

I think there is a big readability issue with the paper. Beside the poor English quality, the main problem is the lack of structure. The organization of the paper is not described at all. The paper is a list of sections that are not introduced at all (what is the section about? why do we need it? how does it contribute to the overall approach?) and without any explicit link between them. 

The other big issue concerning readability is that the different concepts are not sufficiently explained and sometimes, some notations are even introduced without any definition, like for instance path(S_i) in the beginning of section 2.2, or the formula in section 2.1 for computing the response time r_j of a task (it is not said over which set of i the sum iterates). It is also disturbing that the concept of laxity, which is central in the paper, is never formally defined. The paper first defines an upper bound on laxity (section 2.2), then a lower bound and then (section 2.3) a "representation" of the laxity by the response time of tasks but it never gives a formal definition. I had to read paper [Natale and Pappalardo, 2008] to finally be able to get a minimal understanding of what's going on with the present paper. Maybe it could be OK for a specialized conference on real-time systems but I don't think it is for a general conference like IJCAI. 

It would be good to clarify the contributions of the present paper. In particular the fact that the buffer optimization algorithm proposed in [Natale and Pappalardo, 2008] is "not sufficient for buffer optimization" as claimed in the introduction. Does it means that the two algorithms cannot be compared, even on the possibly more restrictive conditions of [Natale and Pappalardo, 2008] ?

The experimental evaluation would also deserve some clarifications:
- What is the "original laxity upper-bound from 2" ?
- Is there a comparison between the algorithms proposed in the paper with other approaches like [Natale and Pappalardo, 2008] (if it makes sense) ?
- What about schedulability? In the introduction and conclusion, there is the claim that the proposed algorithms help improving schedulability but I do not see any evidence of that in the experimental evaluation which is mostly about buffer costs. 

Some typos:
- p1, col2: the code generation tool based [on?] the topology ...
- p1, col2: the the longest task chain
- p2, col1: section 2.1, 2nd item: to on[e] of the inputs
- p3, col1: Equation. 2 (all references to equations and algorithms use this weird "Equation.", "Algorithm." prefixes)
- Algorithms 1 and 4 are never referred to in the text

Summary of review
-----------------

The paper describes a set of algorithms for optimizing buffers in the automatic implementation of a real time system model. 
These algorithms are evaluated in last section of the paper.

The biggest issue with the paper is readability. It could be improved by:
- providing more structure, the objective of each section should be made more clear
- making the paper more self-contained by carefully describing the concepts that are essential to the paper comprehension 
- simplifying or removing things that are not completely necessary. This may imply a refocusing of the paper, for instance by focusing only on the laxity release procedure which seems to be the one that works best
