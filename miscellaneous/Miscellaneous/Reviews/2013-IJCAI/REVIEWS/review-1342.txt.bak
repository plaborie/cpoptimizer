SUMMARY: 

The paper studies the parameterized complexity of some particular restrictions of the cumulative constraint in scheduling and provides new complexity results. 

RELEVANCE: 

Studying the complexity of some particular fragments of a more general problem is something that is very common in the OR scheduling literature but it also clearly makes sense from an AI perspective. Beside theoretical results, this type of work shed some light on the reasons why some problems are difficult and this can also improve their practical resolution.

ORIGINALITY: 

To the best of my knowledge, most of the complexity results described in the paper are new and, indeed in general, there are not that many parameterized complexity results on scheduling problems.

This being said, I do not agree with the statement that "scheduling problems under structural restrictions has received little attention in the literature". There is a huge literature in Operations Research studying particular restrictions of a more general scheduling problems. That was the point of the [alpha|beta|gamma] typology of problems and there are tons of complexity results about restrictions to particular problems (including structural restrictions like the precedence constraints structures). See for instance the classification work of Brucker & Knust:
http://www.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/knust/class/
http://www-desir.lip6.fr/~durrc/query/
And this is only the tip of the iceberg of the complexity results produced by the OR literature.
I would say that the difficulty when providing complexity results is to check that it is really a new result.

For instance, the particular case of nested release dates/due dates has already been studied, mostly for the preemptive version of the problem but there is also some polynomiality results for the non-preemptive case in [1].

SIGNIFICANCE: 

The work described in the paper is important and advances the state of the art in the complexity analysis of scheduling problems. 

TECHNICAL QUALITY: 

I think the nested version of the problem studied in section 3 (without precedence constraints) is in P (I think the nested problem described here is the feasibility version of the optimization problem described in [1]).
Also, on left column of Table 1: it was not shown in the paper that nesting+precedences was NPC.

Some parts of the proofs should be slightly developed. This is the case for the proof of Theorem 4. For instance it is mentioned that "precedences implied by the start intervals" are added to the partial order. Do you mean the cases where r_j+l_j > d_i-l_i ? Is it necessary to include these precedences in the partial order? Is it sufficient? I must admit proof of this theorem should be more detailed.

READABILITY AND ORGANIZATION: 

In general, the paper is well organized and clearly written. 

In the introduction, "global constraints"are introduced as a constraint relation described implicitly as opposed to explicit constraints in CSPs. I'm not sure this is the common meaning of a global constraint (but I know there is no formal definition of it): according to this definition, x<=y would be a global constraint whereas it is in general not considered to be so. A global constraint also need to involve a potentially large number of variables, like the AllDiff, Cumulative or InterDistance.

Proofs are in general not easy to follow, especially the one of theorem 4 (see above). 

In section 5, it would be useful to informally give an idea of what the decomposable planning horizon means in term of global structure. Also, a couple of details in this section:
- In second line of the section it should be S_i subset N and not S_i in N
- The section sometimes speaks of "complete graph" and sometimes of "clique", it would be better to use the same term.

Summary of review
-----------------

The paper studies the parameterized complexity of some particular restrictions of the cumulative constraint in scheduling and provides new complexity results. I think most of the complexity results described in the paper are new but some existing results, particularly in the case of nested task types, should be considered.
