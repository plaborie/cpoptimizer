Should the author(s) be invited to present this at the workshop?
Yes

Why or why not?

The application discribed in the paper is very representative of the
manufacturing domain. It is traditionaly handled by a pure scheduling
approach where the different ways to satisfy a job request are made
explicit and modeled using alternative modes. The authors use a
restriction of the PDDL2.1 language to model the different ways a job
request can be satisfied and use planning techniques to explore those
alternatives. The approach is original and very relevant to the
workshop.

Comments to author(s):

The weak point of the paper is its lack of formalization. The main
concepts of job request, configuration, batches, machines (resources)
and their attached constraints, the temporal data-base and resource
constraints used when planning individual jobs are never formally
defined.

In this application, it seems like there is an asumption that makes
the approach working: the only dependency between jobs is due to
resource constraints and not to predicates involved in pre-
post-conditions of actions. Because of it and because of the
incrementality of the problem, each job can be planned separately,
only taking into account the resource synchronization. Doing so, of
course, the global optimality of the set of unsent plans is not
ensured. Were some attempts made to (re)plan all the unsent plans
together in order to improve the overall objective. Do you think the
method (state-space regression + resource ordering) would scale ?

The empirical evaluation is not very informative because, as said in
the paper, the problem is not really a feasibility problem (one can
always find a solution, even if it is a very bad one), and in the
experiments, nothing is mentioned about the quality of the computed
solution. Given the characteristics of the application, I'm pretty
sure one could compute some relevant lower bounds on the objective
function and it would really be interesting to compare them with the
solution found.
