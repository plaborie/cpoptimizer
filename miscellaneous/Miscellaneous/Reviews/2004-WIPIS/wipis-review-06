Should the author(s) be invited to present this at the workshop?
No

Why or why not?  

The main problem is that this paper is not very relevant to the
workshop. WIPIS is about "Integrating Planning INTO Scheduling". As
underlined in the call for paper, "the central theme of the workshop
is that planning techniques are necessary to the solution of these
problems [scheduling problems with a planning component], but must be
integrated into scheduling algorithms and frameworks." In this paper,
the only "scheduling" algorithm or framework is the Floyd-Warshall's
algorithm running on top of a STN and it is even not clear such an
expensive algorithm is necessary (see comments below).

Comments to author(s):

The contribution of the paper is an extension of a planner to better
handle durative actions when it is necessary to have action
parallelism in a plan. The authors propose:
1- some methods that avoid splitting durative actions (both in the
   relaxed plan graph and for selecting actions) when it is not
   necessary
2- to use an STN to filter the set of possible actions to be applied
   at a given state.

About the second point, I'm not sure a Floyd-Warshall's algorithm
running on top of the STN is necessary. The STN seems to be used only
to ensure feasibility and, testing the feasibility of a STN does not
require a Floyd-Warshall's algorithm that maintains
path-consistency. A simple arc-consistency algorithm (Bellman-Ford)
with positive cycle detection should be enough and would be much
quicker and much less greedy in memory, see for instance [1].

The paper is not very clear about cases more complex than the Match
domain where the concept of envelope (as defined in the paper by a
single action) does not ensure that the final plan is
schedulable. What happens for instance with 4 actions a1,a2,b if in a
solution plan, one must have: start(a1)<start(a2)<end(a1)<end(a2) and
start(a1)<start(b)<end(b)<end(a2) (that is, the envelope containing b
is (a1,a2) ? This doesn't seem to be detected by the proposed
algorithms.
 
The proposed contribution is relevant in the context of the extension
of planners to handle metric constraints but is not really in the
scope of WIPIS. That's why I would suggest the authors to clarify and
improve the paper according to the two points above and submit it to
a workshop or a conference that fits better.

A few typos:

p1,col1, "langauge"

p2,col1, in the action LOAD-TRUCK-INV, I suppose instead of predicate
"load-truck-inv" one should read "load-inv"

p3, col2, under Fig 4, in (i.e. (cond\add)!=0), one should read =0

p5, col1, "scheudlable"
