The paper describes a very interesting extension of Constraint Programming with an original constraint based on Allen interval algebra to constrain a temporal sequence of intervals with respect to a fixed interval.

My main concern about the paper is that it is really difficult to follow, in particular (1) because many concepts are not formally defined and (2) because several terms are often used to denote the same concept. It is only when getting close to the end of the paper and re-reading the paper a couple of times that one gets a reasonable understanding. For instance:

- Monodies are defined (in the beginning of section 2) as a vector of events S = ( s_1, ..., s_n ). Later on, it is said that the *same event* may appear multiple times in a monody. What does "same" means here: all events in a monody have different start/end times as they are temporally sequences, so they are by definition all different (except for the case of null duration events).

- Same issue with the undefined notion of "same" / "different" in the typical horizontal constraints just below. It seems that something is missing in the definition of a monody or of an event, something like an "identifier" that would allow defining the same/different relation between events. This seems to be implicit in the paper.

- Then there is also the notion of "index" and "position" of an event that is also not formally defined. Position seems to be something like a temporal date. What about the index? Is it the index "i" of an event "s_i" ? The examples of typical horizontal constraints do not clarify that: "any two consecutive events are different" is said to hold between events defined by their "index" whereas "the first and last events are identical" is said to hold between events defined by their "position"; I do not see any fundamental difference between the two.

- Then the beginning of section 3 introduces a more general terminology with the notions of channeling constraints between variables and values and relates it with the context of monodies. The problem is that at this point, the Allen constraint has not been introduced so it becomes clear only at the end of the section what are the set variables we are dealing with.

- In this section 3, it lb(I_A) first seems to denote a set variable on some indexes ( lb(I_A) = { i: ... } ) whereas just below it denotes a set of events (lb(I_A)= {a}, ub(I_A)= {a,b}), with a different character policy for I_A by the way.

- Section 4 introduces a notion of "sequence variable" Xi which is also never formally defined. Then there is in section 4.1 a weird sentence: "In this approach, the number necessary sequence variables is optimal: ...". What does "optimal" means in this context? I suppose you are computing a lower and upper bound on the number of events here. Also, this paragraph mentions some numbers related with a previous example: "n=256 instead of n=3840", what is this previous example?

- In Example 1, what do the underscore "a" and "b" means? I suppose it is the events that may satisfy the Allen relation but it would be better to say it. A picture with intervals on the temporal axis would help to understand the example. 

- There is also some not really homogeneous notations across the paper. For instance events are sometimes denoted "s" (in the monodies definition), sometimes "e" in sequence variable definition (in this case "s" denotes the start value), sometimes x (in onset graph definition).

- Section 4.4 mentions "Allen variables", I suppose it is the I and E set variables used in the Allen constraint but it is never explicitly said.

I think the paper would be much improved if focused on a minimal number of concepts, each of them with a formal definition. In general, a few pictures with intervals on the temporal axis would also help.

The lack of readability is really the number one problem with the paper because otherwise it really describes original and interesting ideas. 

A few less important and more technical comments.

As the number of variables is actually not known a-priori, you need to create "dummy" intervals "p" of null duration. Is it not potentially a problem for some combinations of Allen relations because these null duration intervals still may have some effect on the "real" ones? In this context, it may worth looking at the extensions of classical CP in terms of optional interval variables as proposed in [1] and implemented in CP Optimizer [2]. These extensions permit to naturally represent chains of optional time intervals for which only the first "k" ones are considered. Furthermore the above system introduces some global constraints that implements the notion of channeling constraint between two sets of interval variables (see "isomorphism" constraint).

There also seems to be a link between the onset graph described in the paper and the multi-valued decision diagrams in constraint-based scheduling, see [3].

In the 2 applications in the end, due to the particular Allen relations used in the constraints, the Allen variables are always singleton variables. Do you see use-cases where set variables are really necessary? Would it make sense to design some special dedicated propagation algorithms for the case of singleton variables?

Nothing is said about the implementation of your constraints (which search strategy is used, which solver, idea of the time it takes to find a solution, ...). Those constraints seem to have been implemented as you shown some solutions in the two applications so it would be interesting to say a bit more about it.

 It is a bit difficult to assess the paper because of the poor presentation quality but I think that this is really an interesting piece of work. It is a pity that the bad presentation quality artificially complexifies the description of the problem and approach. My overall evaluation as a "weak reject" is a direct consequence of this poor presentation quality.
