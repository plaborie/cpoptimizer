The paper describes an interesting constraint between an interval variable (task) and a set of fixed intervals saying that at the interval variable mus satisfy a given Allen composite relation with at least one of the fixed intervals. A global form of this constraint is proposed that propagates the above constraint for a sequence of interval variables.

The paper is well written and organized and pleasant to read. A naive propagation is first proposed which runs in O(m.n), an optimized version of the propagation that exploits the ordering of both the interval variables and the fixed intervals runs in O(n+m), it is based on a single iteration that advances both the cursor on the interval variables and the fixed intervals. 

In the experimental study, the two versions of the propagation are compared together and against a model using  composite constraints (disjunctions of basic constraints).

In the problem of the experimental study, the proposed ExistAllen constraint is only used for constraint (2). What about constraint (3) and the objective function, how were they modeled in the study ?

One question that is not really addressed in the paper is the one of the genericity of the proposed constraint. In the study, the constraint is used with the "covers" Allen constraint ({fi,di,eq,si}). Do you see other relations that could be useful in other types of applications and would not be covered by classical existing constraints ? The conclusion mentions the visibility windows for satellite communication scheduling with a "during" Allen relation, but this boils down to a much more classical constraint that is commonly used for instance in constraint-based scheduling (no-overlap with a set of fixed forbidden windows). Do you see other real use-cases beside the video summarization problem ?  

==============================================================
Comments after the rebuttal

There is something that should be clarified after your answer to reviewer 3 in the rebuttal. Indeed, 
I do no see why the proposed O(n+m) algorithm does not achieve bound consistency (in case processing times are fixed as specified in Theorem 1) after a single run. Indeed the support smin you compute for the minimal start time of each task T is feasible (there exists an interval I and a relation r such that T r I if T is scheduled to start at smin). So I do not see why this value for the task support would be removed by the propagation of the upper bounds. I may be missing something of course, in this case a counter example would help. I'm even pretty sure that one could ensure an O(n+m) algorithm to achieve bound consistency even in the case of variable processing time. For a given task T (assuming a fixed processing time), for a given relation r and a given interval I_i, if TrI_i is satisfiable, there is a unique minimal start time for the task T such that TrI_i (support) and it is clear that the support for the next interval I_i+1 is larger than the support for I, this explains why the intervals I can be scanned from left to right without risk of missing any support. And it also explains that one can scan the list of tasks T from left to right, using this to also propagate the precedence relations between tasks. In the end, what you show is that one can just iterate over the two lists in parallel, in O(n+m) which is quite intuitive given the considered constraints I find. Then thanks to the notion of reversible supports you describe in section 3.4, you can avoid re-iterating over the complete lists at each search node and I suppose you can get a complexity of O(n+m) from the root node to a leaf node, so I would rather expect an amortized complexity in O(1+m/n) at each search node, so O(1) if m is of the same order as n. It would be useful to clarify these complexity questions in the final version of the paper.
