The main contribution of the paper is a filtering and a lazy clause generation algorithm for cumulative resource with calendars in case the resource is released by suspended activities. This algorithm is an extension of classical time-tabling propagation. The new algorithms are shown to outperform alternative models using existing constraints on the RCPSP with max delays and calendars. 

The main originality of the paper is the treatment of resources that are released by suspended activities (\rho =0), the case of where resources stay engaged (\rho=1) is much more classical. I think the authors should mention the work related with calendars in ILOG Scheduler. For instance, calendars were introduced in [1] and later on extended [2] which resulted in the introduction of modeling concepts related to calendars to model things like:
- the distinction between processing time (executed part) and duration (end-start) of an activity, both possibly being decision variables of the problem
- breakable/non-breakable activities (notion of disjunctive breaks)
- minimal execution time between breaks (to avoid splitting the activity in too small parts)
- break types (to customize the behavior of activities with respect to different type of breaks)
- break overlap (to exceptionally allow an activity to be executed in a break)
- sequence-dependent setup times possibly being suspended by resource breaks
- extension of breaks 0-1 function to efficiency functions (for instance to model a resource that works 50% slower during week-ends)
These notions were later on revamped in CP Optimizer with the concept of "intensity function" related with interval variables. But it is true that none of these notions permit a direct modeling of the case \rho=0.

I think something should be said about the complexity of the new algorithms in section 3.4. In particular:
- what is the worst-case complexity of the propagation and lazy-clause generation ?
- does the complexity of the algorithms depends on the time granularity that is, does the complexity increases if the time unit of the problem is selected to be much smaller (this is quite important in real-world scheduling problems) ?

In the problem description (section 2), you say that in the RCPSPMax problem with calendars, all the time lags can be converted into start to start ones. But in this case you will need to handle variable delays isn't it? For instance if the original precedence is an end to start precedence, once translated as a start to start precedence, the delay will be the duration of the first activity which is not a constant but will depend on where the activity is scheduled (because of breaks).

In all, the results of the experimental study are convincing. 

Do you think that it would help to the cumulative constraints of the model 2cap as redundant constraints in the cumucal model? Those cumulative constraints can indeed take advantage of existing propagators for the cumulative constraint like edge-finding or energy reasoning.

In the experimental section, you compare with a MIP model solved by CPLEX. Did you also try to compare with a scheduling model with CP Optimizer (which is also available in CPLEX Optimization Studio) ? If the notion of intensity function does not directly cover the case \rho=0 as mentioned earlier, it should be quite easy to design a model similar to 2cap where constraints (14-15) are modeled by some fixed interval variable that contribute to the resource with a negative pulse during the execution of an activity.

In the experiments, it is not clear why you seem to need to start from an initial solution ("A runtime limit of 10 minutes was imposed excluding runtimes needed for pre-processing, initial solution generation"). Why do you need to distinguish these different steps and especially the initial solution generation?

A couple of more detailed comments:
- In introduction: "Time periods of unavailability can occur, e.g., due to weekends or public holidays *if the resource type equals staff*.": I don't get the end of the sentence
- section 3.4: "the following conditions hold: ..." for the first condition I would parenthesize the two terms in the disjunction for better readability 
- It would be useful to complete the appendix with a table giving for each instance the current optimal value (or LB and UB)
