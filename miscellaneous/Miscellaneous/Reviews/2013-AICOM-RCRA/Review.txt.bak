Narrative: (sent to corresponding author and other reviewers)

I see that all my comments have been thoroughly and satisfactorily dealt with in the present version of the article. In particular:
- additional details are provided concerning how the initial population and how the schedule horizon is computed 
- the GA approach is compared with other methods like simple makespan minimization, local search and random sampling and is shown to outperform them.

I recommend to accept the paper as is.
