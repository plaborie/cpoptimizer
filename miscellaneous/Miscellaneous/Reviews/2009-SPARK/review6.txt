PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS
(will be sent to authors and distributed amongst attendees)

How is the goal/objective handled in your approach? There do not seem
to be any explicit mention of an objective or any notion of plan
quality. Is it because of the nature of the application (implicitely:
do as a much, as many activities as possible to assist the human)?

GENERAL COMMENTS
(will be sent to authors)

The paper presents an integrated approach for reasoning on sensors
data (for recognizing some situations) and planning activities in the
context of a service-providing environment.

These two types of reasoning have been extensively studied and
generally, independently but some previous approaches are able to
perform the two types of reasoning based on the same modeling
language. For instance the IxTeT language can support both planning
and scheduling taking into account exogenous events (see [1] and
related more recent works) and chronicle recognition (see [2] and
related more recent works). I think a comparison with these previous
works would clarify the contributions of the present paper; one of the
originality being that here, the two types of reasoning (and not only
the model) are integrated even if somehow they are quite "simplified".

The proposed approach seems to rely on some assumptions that should be
explicited and clarified (see below). Maybe these assumptions make
sense for the type of application being treated but, from a general
perspective, they appear quite strong.

For the scheduling and planning of the actuators, it is not clearly
mentioned what is the objective or the goal (in the planning
sense). Does it try to apply all possible synchronizations in some
kind of greedy way? The section on future work seem to suggest it but
I think this type of strong assumption should be stated before.

There does not seem to be a fundamental difference in the way the
time-points are handled depending on whether or not they correspond
to an assumption on the end time of a contingent sensor event or an
event computed from sensor information (example: the human is watching
TV, the end time is a contingent event: we can't decide of its date)
and controllable events corresponding to commands send to actuators
for which the date can be decided by what is actually a decision. For
instance, in the example, how the system can decide to DeliverDrink
(an action that is planned to be executed in the future) given that we
are not sure the human will be WatchingTV at this date (even if this
is not incompatible with the current and past data from the sensors).

A few more detailed comments:

- p3, col1: typo: "occur occur" occurs twice

- The term "decision" used in the paper (this term comes from the OMPS
framework) is very misleading in the present context when it deals
with sensors information as those are contingent events, one cannot
directly "decide" neither on the fact they occur or not, neither on
their occurrence date.

CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS
(for committee only)


Do you think that this paper may represent a seed for a journal paper?

YES [ ]    NO [X]


Additional Comments:

In the current state of the work, it is probably much too early for a
journal paper. But the approach with a tight interaction between
reasonning on sensors data and planning in the same framework is very
attractive and promising, even if not completely original.
