PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS
(will be sent to authors and distributed amongst attendees)

An important component of the cost function handled by the MIP model
(related with WIP) is non-convex. One could expect the linear
relaxation of the MIP to be quite loose and not very informative. Do
you have an idea of the tightness of this relaxation? Do you have an
idea why the MIP works reasonably well on this problem?

GENERAL COMMENTS
(will be sent to authors)

The scheduling problem introduced in this paper is quite challenging,
specially because of the complex cost involving some non-convex
functions (work in progress). The proposed approach seems very
relevant (goal programming using CP or MIP depending on the
sub-problem) and is illustrative of how real industrial scheduling
problems are handled.

It is strange that follow-up maintenance and separation preferences
appear as "side-constraints", after the disruption and
earliness/tardiness costs as these preferences are handled with higher
priority in the problem. Furthermore, I think the description of these
"side-constraints" should be more formalized as there may be some
ambiguities on how exactely the related cost is estimated. In fact,
they probably should be described with the same level of detail as the
other objective/constraints.

I have the feeling the general comparison between CP and MIP
approaches (section on Solution approach) does not completely justify
the use of MIP. It is true that CP has difficulties handling
non-convex objectives but I'm not sure MIP is very good at it
too. From the other side, it is mentioned that Time-indexed MIP
formulations are efficient solving sums of non-regular costs but CP
can be good at it too, provided that the costs are more or less
convex. Do you have an idea of how tight is the linear relaxation of
your MIP model given the non-convexity of the WIP functions ? For
instance, what is the cost of the linear relaxation at the root node?

The description of the CP approach would deserve a more detailed
description (in fact, there is still almost 1 page available before
reaching the 6 page limit). The 3 objectives handled by CP are
themselves handled using a goal programming approach and it would be
interesting to describe, in particular, how separation and follow-up
preferences are modeled and handled.

Nothing is said about the typical problem size for a given toolset. Is
Figure 2 representative of a complete schedule for a given toolset?
It would also be useful to have an idea of the quality of the
generated schedules. Is each step in the goal-programming approach
able to prove optimality of the generated solution? If not, do we have
an idea of the gap? Is there a possible comparison with the quality of
the existing approach at IBM's 300mm East Fishkill fab?
