PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS
(will be sent to authors and distributed amongst attendees)

The proposed model uses an object-oriented representation with a
description of the possible evolution of state variables over
time. This seems to be quite close to the approach used in time-line
based modeling frameworks such as OMPS. How does it compare?

GENERAL COMMENTS
(will be sent to authors)

The topic of the paper is a very complex planning and scheduling
application in the context of crude-oil distribution. Research on this
type of problem is quite active and the problem is known to be a good
challenge for the different optimization approaches and their
hybridization, see for instance [1].

Relaxation of a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program Using Constraint
Programming". Proc. CP-AI-OR'09. 2009.

The paper presents a very interesting knowledge engineering approach
for the modelization of the problem. The model uses an object-oriented
representation with a description of the possible evolution of state
variables over time. From this perspective, a comparison with
time-line based modeling frameworks such as OMPS [2] would be
informative.

If the modeling aspect is interesting and, as far as I know, quite
original (I think it is the central point of the paper), the part on
problem resolution is weaker. It is advocated that current MILP and
MINLP methods do not satisfactorily solve the problem, which is true,
but the planning approach described here seems to over simplify it due
to the limitations of current planners (no continuous variables,
limited management of time). For instance, one important aspect of the
problem that is hard for MILP (and justify the use of MINLP) is the
non-linear nature of oil mixing. In the paper, it is not described
how, in the proposed model, different oils can be mixed and what is
the impact on quality. Another example is the minimization of total
time (and, more generally, the maximization of the oil flaw) that is
approximated by a minimization of the number of temporized actions.

The problem statement is sometimes unclear:

- Tank requirements: can a given tank be loaded several times before
it is unloaded. In this case, when is the settling period initiated?
At the last moment it was loaded?

- Pipeline requirements: it is said that pipelines can transport
simultaneously more than one crude oil type but, later on, that a
pipeline must not be used to unload distinct tanks
simultaneously. Could you clarify? How are oil interfaces defined? A
more formal definition would help.

- The objective 2 (value of oil sent: low or high quality) is not
clear. It is said that there is a cost related with sending low
quality oil to the refineries. This notion of quality seem to be
related with the mixing of oil but it is not clear how.

In the experimental section, you mention that MIPS-XXL produced
invalid sequences of actions. Why? Is it because of a bug in the
planner or because the model given to the planner is not correct?

The charts on figure 11 and 16 depict some continuous variables
whereas it is explicitly said that the model does not handle them. Is
it just to have a more realistic display?

In the experimental section and in the conclusion, it is mentioned
that the solution has shown to be efficient on non-considered cost
functions (e.g docking related costs). If those costs were not
modeled, I guess it cannot be related to a merit of the approach
itself and it is probably due to the interaction with other (modeled)
costs. For instance here, one can expect that minimizing the total
time of the plan will implicitly try to finishing to unload the
tankers as soon as possible thus helping minimizing the docking
related costs.

Most of the figures are not readable. This should be improved for the
final version.
