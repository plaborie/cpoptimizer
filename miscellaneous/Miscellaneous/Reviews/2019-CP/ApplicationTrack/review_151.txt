Review

The article presents an approach based on bilevel optimization to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP).

There are many issues with the paper.

1- The article does not really match the topics of the conference: there is nothing about CP in the paper. CP is even not mentioned in the state-of-the-art in the introduction whereas the best results on the FJSSP so far (on the classical instances used in the paper) have been obtained with CP. 

2- The proposed bilevel method is far from being clear. First, it is very uncommon that a classical (monolevel) combinatorial problem like the FJSSP is reformulated as a bilevel optimization problem which is a far more complex framework. I do not see the interest of this reformulation as here, both the leader and the follower share the very same objective function (the makespan). And in general solving a bilevel optimization problem is much more difficult that solving a mono-level one. In the paper, it is not said how the bilevel problem is solved. In particular, you write "In fact, the leader searches for the best operation assignment and communicates it to the follower. According to the leader’s choice, the follower makes its decision and returns an optimal solution which is an optimal scheduling of the fixed assignment as a response to the leader’s selection. Both leader and follower attempt to minimize the total completion time objective function (Cmax)." How does the leader exploit the optimal solutions produced by the follower? This is not said in the paper. In fact the described approach seems close to a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition for which the follower would provide some cut to the leader/master problem. But this is not mentioned.

3- The results are not compared against the state-of-the-art methods, in particular the best CP ones on this problem like [1] or [2,3]. Some more or less up-to-date results on the classical FJSSP benchmarks are available here: https://www.quintiq.com/optimization/flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem-results.html. In particular, all the instances studied in the paper are closed (except for Brandimarte MK10)

4- I think that there are some mistakes in the experimental results. On tables 1 and 2, the makespans found by the proposed bilevel approach are sometime lower than the known optimal value reported on the page mentioned above (MK01: 36<40*, MK02: 24<26*, MK05: 171<172*, la11: 1078<1103). Also, note a similar problem with reported result of MAS-GATS for MK01 (39<40*). There is really something weird going on here.
