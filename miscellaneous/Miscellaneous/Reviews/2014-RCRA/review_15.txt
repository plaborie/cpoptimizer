The paper proposes an adaption of Differential Mutation to the permutation flow-shop scheduling problem with minimization of total flow time. The idea is very interesting and, to the best of my knowledge, very original. The paper is easy to read and the adaptation of Differential Evolution (usually applied to continuous optimization problems) to a discrete optimization problem like the permutation flow-shop problem is well described. It would be interesting, if possible, to give a bit more details and intuitions about the reasons why differential mutation works on continuous problems (the so-called contour matching property) and why/if the proposed adaptation to a discrete permutation problem is expected to exploit the same ideas. 

Surprisingly, the choice of the generator set is not motivated by the reasons why differential mutation is expected to work, but by consideration on the smoothness of the objective function landscape. Did you investigate the others generator sets T and I in some experiments?

In fact, my main comment and question about the paper is that, although differential mutation seems to be an interesting and original tool in this type of problem, the experiments do not really provide an evidence for that. The experiments seem to clearly indicate that the overall approach performs very well on the problem, but the differential evolution is only one of the ingredients of the approach beside the crossover, the way selection is performed, the use of a constructive heuristic in the initial population, the local search, the restart, etc. It would for instance be very informative to see how the approach behaves when differential mutation (in line 4 of algorithm 2) is replaced by, let's say, the random selection of an individual in the population or a purely random individual, or the result of a path relinking between two randomly selected individuals, ... Otherwise, in the end, even if the idea of differential mutation looks attractive, there is no real proof that it is the main ingredient to the success of the approach.

More detailed comments:

As far as I understand it, the result of differential mutation for an individual xi, results in a totally different individual that is built from randomly selected individuals x_r0, x_r1, x_r2 (not including xi). This is quite different from the usual definition of mutation in classical evolutionary algorithm where a mutation is usually a rather small random change for a given individual so that the mutant keeps many characteristics of the original individual. I'm wondering if this the usual definition in Differential evolution algorithms but it makes the understanding of algorithm 2 a bit difficult as in fact, if I understand well, in line 4,  DifferentialMutation(i) does not really depend on i.
