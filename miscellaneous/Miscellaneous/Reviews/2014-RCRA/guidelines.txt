GUIDELINES TO REVIEWERS

THIS IS AN INFORMAL WORKSHOP
RCRA is an informal workshop and mainly aims at fostering discussion and
cross-fertilisation of ideas stemming from different areas (see CfP).
Please write constructive and detailed reviews that may help authors to
improve their work.


ALREADY PUBLISHED PAPERS
Authors of accepted papers belonging to
the "already published paper" category will *not* be asked
to prepare a final version, as this could violate the
copyright agreements already signed by them.
RCRA will publish for those papers only a DOI link to
their copyrighted versions.
Nevertheless, your detailed comments will be very valuable
to authors, especially if they plan to participate to the
forthcoming selection stage for journal publication.



SUBMISSION TO A JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE
Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their work to the forthcoming selection of the best papers
to be published in a special issue of a high-level international journal.
Please dedicate a section of your report to give detailed feedback
about which improvements you would expect to see for such an
extended version to be accepted.
In particular, take into consideration that a significant amount of
additional material is needed wrt. what present in any copyrighted
version of this paper.

Finally, please tell us (in the confidential comments)
whether you consider extremely hard for the authors
to succeed with their journal submission
(submissions expected in September).
