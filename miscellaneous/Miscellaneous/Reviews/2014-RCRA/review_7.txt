This paper was published as an ICAPS 2010 short paper "Temporal Planning with Problems Requiring Concurrency through Action Graphs and Local Search".

I find the paper quite difficult to read, mostly I think because of the lack of space in the original paper format. An indeed, the extension of LPG to handle required concurrency is interesting and would deserve a more detailed description and study than presented here. 

Many definitions should be made more formal, for instance the notions of flaw and the different ways to solve them in the end of section 2. In general, a flaw (causal relation, mutex, temporal flaw) is associated with a disjunctive set of constraints/methods to fix it. But in this part of the text, everything seems to be a bit mixed up ("Each causal/mutex relation involving a planned snap action s(a) (e(a)) generates an ordering constraint..., with the following exception, ..."). The definition of a temporal flaw is also not very clear as it mentions "maximum level snap action node" whereas the motivating property refers to a "minimum level" temporal flaw. The relation between the two is not clear.

The definition of the possible graph changes in the local search (section 3) should be better motivated. It is clear that each of these changes represents a step forward in order to solve a flaw but is there some underlying property that these changes are, in a certain sense, sufficient to reach a solution? Does it make the search space connected? This issue especially applies to the propositional flaws (P1-4). And by the way, these changes for solving propositional changes are introduced as an "alternative definition", but it is an alternative to what? (As far as I understand, propositional and temporal flaws are two different types of flaws that need to be fixed in any case, so " propositional flaws" are clearly not an alternative to "temporal flaws" that were described just before). It is difficult to understand why this "restricted" neighborhood works well and, to which extent it is robust (the experimental comparison with other approaches is not performed on a large number of domains, only 3). 

Note that the link to the test domains and problems seems to be dead (Error 404), so it is hard to have an idea of the complexity and diversity of the domains.

To summarize, I think that an extended version of the paper in a journal would really make sense. But it will require some important improvement of the paper, in particular:
1. a more formal description of the flaws, resolution methods and local search neighborhoods, 
2. if possible an analyze of global properties of the search space (is it possible to reach all solutions, or only a subset of them, which ones, ...) and some algorithmic complexity of the different ingredients of the approach (detection of temporal flaws, or the extension that considers temporal flaws when addition snap actions) and 
3. a more detailed experimental section, in particular to better justify the choices of the (restricted) neighborhoods
