Further comments (good and bad) to be passed back to the author(s) of
the paper, including advice or explanations. Please be as specific and
constructive as possible. Use as much space as you need.

The modeling trick to squeeze tool change activities is elegant. It
allows decoupling the delays introduced by tool changes and the
disjunctive aspects of the machine itself and in particular to re-use
efficient algorithms for propagating the sum of completion times. 

This modeling trick together with the problem specific dominance rules
explain the good results reported in the section about experimental
results.

The model is probably hard to extend to more complex problems where
for instance the exact position of tool change activities in time is
important (for instance if there are several machines and if tool
change activities require some common resources).
