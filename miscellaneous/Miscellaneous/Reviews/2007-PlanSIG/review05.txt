Further comments (good and bad) to be passed back to the author(s) of
the paper, including advice or explanations. Please be as specific and
constructive as possible. Use as much space as you need.

The modular approach proposed in the paper is interesting and the
focus on "components" quite original and justifies, in itself, the
fact the paper should be accepted for presentation at a PlanSIG
workshop. I think this is a very interesting direction. But it is hard
to get a detailed understanding of the paper because it is very
informal both at the level of the modeling of the components and at
the level of the support for problem solving. In fact, it is hard to
distinguish what are the services provided by the OMPS architecture
from what needs to be implemented by the user.

For instance, one does not really see where the complexity of problem
solving (NP-complete in general) is hidden: is it in applying domain
theory, in scheduling time-lines, in time-lines completion ? I guess
it is in all these steps but it is not clear how OMPS helps. Maybe the
running example should be complexified a little bit so as to better
illustrate the added-value of OMPS.

In the domain theory, synchronizations are illustrated on state
variables. What about synchronizations on resources ? Isn't it a
problem that resources are cumulative and that for instance the
conjunction of two decisions with quantities q1 and q2 is equivalent
to a single decision with quantity q1+q2 ? In this context, what does
it mean to reason about resource decisions in the domain theory ?


A few typos: 

- p1, column1, "Due to the constraints ...". I think "Due to" should
be removed or the sentence rephrased.
- p7, column1, "the the"
