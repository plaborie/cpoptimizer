The readability of the article has been improved quite a lot since the original submission and it is now easier to understand the CP model, even if, I must admit, someone not familiar with CP Optimizer may find it hard to understand all the details. 

In particular I think you should at least define the notion of "optional interval variable" which is the main decision variable you are using in your model and insisting on the notion of optionality (with a special value "absent" in the domain of the decision variable). Otherwise, it is impossible to understand the "alternative" constraints and how the resource allocation part of the problem is formulated in the CP model.

Sometimes, on the contrary, the description goes to much into the details, in particular the boolean argument ("1") of the noOverlap constraint (end of p 13) is really not necessary unless you explain in detail what it means (I would just remove this argument in the noOverlap constraints 2-5).

On page 17, the part of the model related with constraints 19-21 is still not very clear. Is it not the case that constraints (19) and (20) are subsumed by constraint (20)? In fact it seems to me that you could use the concept of "intensity function" to formulate these constraints more directly in the model. If the constraints is that a certain amount of time equal to AgingTime_i must elapse between the breaks, then it is exactely what intensity functions stand for. The formulation of these constraints (19-20) result in very weak inferences in the engine so alternative formulations could help a lot here. 

Maybe you could cite this very recent article that is a survey of CP Optimizer with a detailed description of the modeling concepts and also some examples of recent applications using this approach:

[1] P. Laborie, J. Rogerie, P. Shaw, P. Vilim . IBM ILOG CP Optimizer for Scheduling. Constraints journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, pp210-250.

There are some strange statements about CP in the begining of the article:

- In the abstract: "CP is a mathematical optimization tool for solving problems either for optimality (for small-size problems) or feasibility (for large-size problems)." The term "feasibility" seems to suggest that for large-size problems, CP is good only for producing feasible solutions. I think that it is also good at taking the objective function into account and finding "good quality feasible solutions". And as far as optimality is concerned, there are several types of scheduling problems (for instance classical jobshop or RCPSP) for which CP proves optimality for problems larger than MIP. I would replace the term "feasibility" here by something like "for finding good quality solutions".

- "CP is the only technique which integrates a computer program in its solution model formulation." I do not understand. CP, just like MIP is mostly based on a declarative formulation of your model. I do not understand what is this computer program in the model formulation. Do you mean that usually in CP (but not in CP Optimizer), the user also need to write a search algorithm ?

In several places in the article, you mention "IBM ILOG CP Optimization tool" (page 11), "CPLEX V12.8" (in the experiments), "IBM ILOG CP" (page 22). I think you should homogeneize and speak of "CP Optimizer" (or "IBM CP Optimizer") because otherwise it is a bit confusing ("CPLEX" is the Math. Programming engine, "ILOG CP" is the "old" generation of CP Optimizer).

Some other minor comments:

- In the model, I would replace the constraints 'startAtEnd(y,x)' by constraints 'endAtStart(x,y)'. These constraints are just the same but the later version is easier to read as 'x' is before 'y', both in time and in the arguments of the constraints.

- p16, l58: "a non-meta conditional constraint" ? Maybe just "a "conditional constraint" is sufficient? See also my comment above on the inefficiency of this type of formulation in CP.

As a conclusion, I think that the article can be accepted because it introduces an efficient declarative model to solve a complex real-world scheduling problem, but there are still some minor improvements needed in order to make the article easier to read for non-(CP Optimizer experts).
