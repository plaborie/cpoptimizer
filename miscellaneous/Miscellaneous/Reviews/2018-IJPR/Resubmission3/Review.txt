I think the paper is now very close to acceptance *but* there is still an important issue to be fixed: with the new experimental results shown on Table 2, again as it used to be in the original version of the article, for some instances where both MILP and CP finish before the time limit (600s) and thus prove optimality, the value of the optimal makespan is different for MILP and for CP. This does not make any sense. For example for instance 1, MILP finds an optimal of 129 whereas CP finds a "worse" optimal value at 130. For instance 2, it is the opposite: CP finds a "better" optimal value than MILP. This should be fixed in the final version.
