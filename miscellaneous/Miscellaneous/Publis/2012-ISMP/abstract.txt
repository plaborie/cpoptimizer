Scheduling is not only about deciding when to schedule a predefined set of activities. Most of real-world scheduling problems also involve selecting a subset of activities (oversubscribed problems) and a particular way to execute them (resource or mode allocation, alternative recipes, pre-emptive activity splitting, etc.). We present the notion of conditional interval variable in the context of Constraint Programming and show how this concept can be leveraged to model and solve complex scheduling problems involving both temporal and non-temporal decisions.
