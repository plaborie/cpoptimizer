{\bf Abstract:} This paper introduces the concept of  Resource Temporal Network (RTN),
a  constraint network that subsumes  both classical attributes used in
A.I.  Planning    and  capacity resources  traditionally   handled  in
Scheduling. After giving a formal definition of RTNs, we analyze their
expressive  power and study complexities  of  several fragments of the
RTN framework. We show that solving an RTN is in general NP-Complete -
which is  not surprising  given the  expressivity  of the framework  -
whereas computing a Necessary Truth Criterion is polynomial. This last
result opens the door for promising algorithms to solve RTNs.\\

{\bf  Content Areas:}   planning,   scheduling,   computational complexity.\\

{\bf Acknowledgements:}   I  would  like  to  thank Andr\'e  Kezdy  of
University    of Louisville for  pointing   me  to  some very relevant
articles about the maximum weight convex set problem on posets as well
as many others  graph theorists  who got  interested in this  problem.
Special thanks    to Emmanuel Gu\'er\'e   and Pascal    Massimino  for
enlightening discussions on  the  RTN semantics and complexity  issues
and to Francis Sourd for carefully proofreading the paper.\\
