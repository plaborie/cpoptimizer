Abstract:
This paper summarizes   the main   existing approaches  to   propagate
resource constraints  in  Constraint-Based  scheduling and  identifies
some of their limitations for using them in an integrated planning and
scheduling framework. We then describe two new algorithms to propagate
resource constraints on discrete resources and reservoirs. Unlike most
of the   classical work in scheduling,  our  algorithms focus   on the
precedence relations between activities  rather than on their absolute
position in time. They are  efficient even when  the set of activities
is not completely  defined and when the time  window of activities  is
large.  These  features explain why   our  algorithms are particularly
suited  for integrated planning  and   scheduling approaches. All  our
algorithms  are   illustrated with  examples.  Encouraging preliminary
results are  reported on  pure  scheduling  problems as  well as  some
possible extensions of our framework.
