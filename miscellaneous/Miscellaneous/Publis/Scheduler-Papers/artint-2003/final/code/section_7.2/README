DATA FILES: data

These data  files  correspond to classical   jobshop benchmarks in the
scheduling literature. More precisely:

o abz5-abz9  are from "The shifting  bottleneck procedure for job shop
  scheduling" by J. Adams, E. Balas and D. Zawack (1988).

o ft06   and ft20  are     from Fisher and    Thompson  in "Industrial
  Scheduling" edited by Muth and Thompson (1963).

o la01-la40  are  from  "Resource constrained project   scheduling: an
  experimental  investigation of  heuristic  scheduling techniques" by
  S. Lawrence (1984).

o orb1-orb10  are from   "A  computational   study of  the    job-shop
  scheduling problem" by  D. Applegate and  W. Cook  (1991); they were
  generated in Bonn in 1986.

Data format:

Each file contains the data for one instance.  Each file consists of a
line containing  the  number of  jobs  and  the  number  of  machines,
followed  by one  line for  each job, listing   the machine number and
processing  time  for each  operation  of  the  job, respectively. The
machines are numbered starting with 0. As an example we give ft06:

 6  6
 2   1  0   3  1   6  3   7  5   3  4   6 
 1   8  2   5  4  10  5  10  0  10  3   4 
 2   5  3   4  5   8  0   9  1   1  4   7 
 1   5  0   5  2   5  3   3  4   8  5   9 
 2   9  1   3  4   5  5   4  0   3  3   1 
 1   3  3   3  5   9  0  10  4   4  2   1 

This means that 6 jobs  and 6 machines are  given, and that the  first
job consists  of 6 operations  that are to  be scheduled  in sequence,
respectively on machine  2 with processing  time 1, on  machine 0 with
processing time 3 etc.
