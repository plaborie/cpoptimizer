  title = {An investigation into two approaches for resource allocation and

  abstract = {One source of complexity in tackling realistic scheduling problems
	comes from activities with resource alternatives. Such activities
	have a choice of resources to utilize. These resources may vary in
	their processing speed and the constraints upon them. The decision
	of which resource to use to process an activity can have a significant
	impact upon the quality of the schedule. A number of approaches for
	dealing with combined resource allocation and scheduling problems
	have been proposed. In this paper we present new techniques based
	on two of these approaches: complete decomposition prior to scheduling
	and multiple alternative decomposition scheduling. We investigate
	experimentally whether the higher computational cost of decision
	making and added complexity of using multiple alternative decompositions
	results in better scheduling performance than the complete decomposition
	prior to scheduling approach.},

  year = {2006},
  __markedentry = {[pvilim]},
  abstract = {Multi-machine scheduling problems have earned themselves a reputation
	of intractability. In this thesis we try to solve a special kind
	of these problems, the so-called no-wait job shop problems. In an
	instance of this problem-class we are given a number of operations
	that are to be executed on a given set of machines. Thereby each
	operation is pre-assigned a machine, an operation-specific processing
	time, an operation-specific release date and deadline. Between some
	of the operations we are given constraints like: One operation has
	to start some fixed number of time-units after another operation
	has finished processing. We try to solve such instances using a method
	called `constraint propagation'. The term `constraint propagation'
	thereby refers to the method of acquiring and propagating knowledge
	from one aspect of a problem instance to another one. This process
	is carried out until nothing can be propagated anymore. In this case
	we assume a possible characteristic of a solution in one branch and
	propagate this characteristic to the rest of the instance, while
	we assume the opposite characteristic in another branch. In this
	thesis we derive new methods to acquire and propagate knowledge for
	no-wait job shop instances, so-called `propagators'. These new methods
	are stronger than the ones found in literature, and are designed
	to use special features of the no-wait job shop instances. Furthermore,
	we give some special-designed methods to detect that a given no-wait
	job shop problem instance does not admit a feasible schedule at all.
	However, our experiments indicate that some of the methods to detected
	infeasibility become useless once we used a certain combination of
	the special designed propagators proposed in this thesis. Moreover,
	we investigate the connection between constraint propagation and
	an ILP formulation of the no-wait job shop problem. We show that
	there is a characterization of some of the strongest possible inequalities
	of this ILP in terms of propagators and some easy-to-check helper
	properties. These characterizations allow us to give an algorithm
	that finds valid inequalities that are violated by a given point
	of the LP relaxation of the ILP, and an algorithm that strengthens
	given valid inequalities.},
