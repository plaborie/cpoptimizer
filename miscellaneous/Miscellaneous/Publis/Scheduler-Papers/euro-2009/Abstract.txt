Title:

Modeling and solving resource-constrained project scheduling problems with IBM ILOG CP Optimizer

Abstract:

Since version 2.0, IBM ILOG CP Optimizer provides a new scheduling
language supported by a robust and efficient automatic search. We will
show how the main features of resource-constrained project scheduling
such as work-breakdown structures, optional tasks, different types of
resources, multiple modes and skills, resource calendars and objective
functions such as earliness/tardiness, unperformed tasks or resource
costs can be modeled in CP Optimizer. The robustness of the automatic
search will be illustrated on some classical resource-constrained
project scheduling benchmarks.
