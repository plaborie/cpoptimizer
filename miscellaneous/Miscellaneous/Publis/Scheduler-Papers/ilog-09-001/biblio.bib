  abstract = {Timetabling problems have been studied a lot over the last decade.
	Due to the complexity and the variety of such problems, most work
	concern static problems in which activities to schedule and resources
	are known in advance, and constraints are fixed. However, every timetabling
	problem is subject to unexpected events (consider for example, for
	university timetabling problems, a missing teacher, or a slide projector
	breakdown). In such a situation, one has to quickly build a new solution
	which takes these events into account and which is preferably not
	too different from the current one. We introduce in this paper constraint-programming
	based tools for solving dynamic timetabling problems modelled as
	RCPSP (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems). This approach
	uses explanation-based constraint programming and operational research
	techniques. },
