This software has been used in the negative cycle detection study
by B. V. Cherkassky and A. V. Goldberg, described in 
"Negative-Cycle Detection Algorithms," Technical Report 96-029,
NEC Research Institute, Princeton, NJ, available via URL

These programs are designed to run under UNIX (most flavors).

Installation
------------

To compile programs and generators:

1) Edit ./Makefile and ./src/Makefile if needed.

2) from this directory type

	make install

The binaries will then all be found in the bin subdirectory.  
The programs all expect to receive input from standard input
and write output to standard output. There are scripts in the
scripts directory which run the implementations on the generators
provided in this distribution.


Other information
-----------------

If for any reason you need to rebuild all binaries, just type

   make clean

in the src directory before the command "make install".
