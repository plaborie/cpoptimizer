Files in this directory contain the results for each experiment specified by 
the scripts in the "scripts" folder. Files ending by "_a" contain values 
averaged against different randomly generated inputs by the same input
parameters. Each file reports the parameters defining inputs and the measured 
indicators:

n         number of nodes
m         number of edges
MinW      minimum edge weight
MaxW      maximum edge weight
Seed      seed for random source (only files not ending by "_a")
DOpC      number of performed decrease operations
IOpC      number of performed increase operations
InitTm    intialization time (sec)
DecrTm    decrease time over the whole sequence (sec)
IncrTm    increase time over the whole sequence (sec)
MaxDOpTm  maximum decrease operation time (sec)
AvgDOpTm  average decrease operation time (sec)
MaxIOpTm  maximum increase operation time (sec)
AvgIOpTm  average increase operation time (sec)
AvgDN     average number of nodes scanned by priority per decrease operation
AvgDM     average number of edges scanned per decrease operation
AvgIN     average number of nodes scanned by priority per increase operation
AvgIM     average number of edges scanned per increase operation

File names include the values of parameters defining the experiment.

Example: file "e_100.500_-10.10_0.5_m_bfm_a" reports results for the 
experiment performed for algorithm bfm on graphs with nodes increasing from 
100 to 500,  edge weights in the range [-10,10], edge density 50% of n^2, and 
intermixed sequences of modifying decrease/increase operations. Values are 
averaged against different seeds.
