
           Software of Dynamic Algorithms for Transitive Closure
           -----------------------------------------------------

                      Installation Instructions


This version of the software package is to be installed on a SUN Solaris
or Linux machine, with g++ compiler (2.95), and LEDA-4.2.


1. Uncompress and untar the file Zaro-expdtc-software-leda-4.2.tar.gz: 

     prompt> gunzip Zaro-expdtc-software-leda-4.2.tar.gz
     prompt> tar xvf Zaro-expdtc-software-leda-4.2.tar

   The following files and directories should have been created

   Experiments/                       Contains a link to the experimentation platform 
                                      (dtc_test) which has to be invoked from this directory 
                                      and may also contain some data used in the experiments
                                      (subdirectory Data). See also the included README file
                                      in that directory.
 
   INSTALL                            (a copy of) this file

   README                             A general introduction to the software.

   exp-dtc/                           Contains the source and header files of the
                                      software package.


2. Download file LEDA-4.2-sparc-solaris-g++-2.95.tar.gz (for Solaris) or 
   the file LEDA-4.2-i386-linux-g++-2.95.tar.gz (for Linux) from 
   http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/faculty/zaro/software/. 
   These files contain the required LEDA-4.2 object code and are the latest free 
   distributions of LEDA. These files are provided under the understanding that they 
   are necessary for the current software and should not be used for commercial purposes.

   Uncompress and untar the file LEDA-4.2-sparc-solaris-g++-2.95.tar.gz or the
   file LEDA-4.2-i386-linux-g++-2.95.tar.gz. After that, follow the instructions 
   in the file
   
     LEDA-4.2-sparc-solaris-g++-2.95/INSTALL or LEDA-4.2-i386-linux-g++-2.95/INSTALL 
   
   to install the LEDA-4.2 object package.


3. Go to the directory exp-dtc which was created in step 1,
   and list its contents.

     prompt> cd exp-dtc
     prompt> ls

   It should contain (at least) the following files and subdirectories.

     Makefile        a makefile for compiling the package
     README          a general description of the directory exp-dtc
     lconfig         shell script used for configuration
                     (should be executable)
     confdir/        a directory with information for automatic
                     configuration
     demo/           demo program
     incl/           include files (follow the subdirectories)
     src/            source code of the implementations 
     test/           tools for performance measurements


4. Type 'make configure'.

     prompt> make configure

   to start the automatic configuration procedure. You will be prompted for the C++ compiler 
   you want to use (e.g., g++), for the path to the LEDA include files (if necessary), e.g., 
   /usr/local/LEDA-4.2-sparc-solaris-g++-2.95/incl, and for the path to the LEDA libraries,
   e.g., /usr/local/LEDA-4.2-sparc-solaris-g++-2.95. 


5. Type 'make'

     prompt> make

   to compile the software package. Then the library libLEP_dynamic_graphs.a
   is assembled, and the demo and test programs are made in the
   subdirectories demo and test, respectively. There are some options, e.g., 
   making the library with debugging support enabled. See the Makefile for these options.
   If you want to recompile, you don't need to repeat step 4; simply type 'make'. 
   During recompilation the old configuration files are used.


6. If you want to reconfigure (e.g., to give new paths for LEDA include files 
   and directories), use the following commands.

     prompt> make configure
     prompt> make
