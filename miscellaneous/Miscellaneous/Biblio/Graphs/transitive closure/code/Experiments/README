
  Experimenting with the Software of Dynamic Algorithms for Transitive Closure
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


To experiment with the software simply type 'dtc_test' :

   prompt> dtc_test

A graphical interface will appear which allows you to generate experiments
with random and non-random inputs ("Generate" button), to load experimental data 
that have already been generated ("Load" button), to run newly generated or
existing data ("Run" button), and to visualize the results ("Show Result" button). 

When an experiment is run both its input as well as its output is stored in some 
subdirectory of the directory 'Data' (default name "Session-1") which can be specified 
by the user when the package prompts for "Name of Test Sequence". 

To view experimental data for which output has been generated, simply load them 
using the "Load" button and press subsequently the "Show Result" button.
