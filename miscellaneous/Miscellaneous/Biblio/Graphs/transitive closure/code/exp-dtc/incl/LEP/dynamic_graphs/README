This directory contains the header files of the implemented dynamic
algorithms for transitive closure as well as those of the base classes 
of the LEDA Extension Package on Dynamic Graph Algorithms developed and 
maintained by D. Alberts, G. Cattaneo and G. Italiano (suitably 
modified by G. Prasinos and C. Zaroliagis to run with LEDA-4.2).
The correspondence between the files and the names of the algorithms 
as they appear in the article are as follows:
