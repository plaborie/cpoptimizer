  Abstract                 = {Timetabling problems have been studied a lot over the last decade. Due to the complexity and the variety of such problems, most work concern static problems in which activities to schedule and resources are known in advance, and constraints are fixed. However, every timetabling problem is subject to unexpected events (consider for example, for university timetabling problems, a missing teacher, or a slide projector breakdown). In such a situation, one has to quickly build a new solution which takes these events into account and which is preferably not too different from the current one. We introduce in this paper constraint-programming based tools for solving dynamic timetabling problems modelled as RCPSP (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems). This approach uses explanation-based constraint programming and operational research techniques. },
