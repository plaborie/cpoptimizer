            <P>An important component in the cost of doing business is the 
            inventory cost associated with work in process (WIP). This is 
            composed of partially completed products either undergoing or 
            awaiting processing. For many companies, WIP is a large component of 
            the total assets of the company. Compared to other assets of the 
            company, WIP in almost all cases does not contribute to 
            profitability, and it is often a goal of management to reduce or 
            eliminate it. The popular just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing 
            philosophy has the goal of producing a unit of product only as it is 
            required, thus reducing WIP to its absolute minimum. Along with this 
            we have JIT raw material deliveries and JIT finished goods 
            manufacturing, all designed to reduce as much as possible the level 
            of inventory.</P>
            <P>The time a product takes to pass through the manufacturing 
            process, or the cycle time, is strongly related to the WIP. There 
            are many reasons we would like to keep this time small rather than 
            large, so the reduction of WIP has the dual effect of reducing cycle 
            time.</P>
            <P>WIP does have the positive function of protection against 
            variability. One reason for providing finished goods inventory is to 
            protect against the variability of customer demand. A reason for 
            keeping raw material inventory is to protect against the uncertainty 
            of raw material supply. WIP within the process protects against 
            machine operation time variability and flow variability. It is 
            important to keep a buffer stock available for a critical machine so 
            that the machine is never starved for materials. WIP may protect 
            against machine failures by allowing some parts of the process to 
            operate while others are down for repair.</P>
            <P>WIP is also used to reduce the effects of setup times (or costs). 
            A product with a large setup time on a machine must be produced in 
            large lots so that the setup time is spread over a number of units. 
            Raw materials are often ordered in large lots because transportation 
            and ordering costs have economies of scale and large fixed costs 
            cause small lots to be expensive. We will see that large lot sizes 
            increase WIP.</P>
            <P>The add-in provides a variety of models for measuring WIP, cycle 
            time and the cost of WIP. Each model describes a component of the 
            production system. The results can be combined to evaluate an entire 
            system. We assume steady-state flows with continuous and constant 
            demands. Except for the queuing model, we assume no random 
            variability. Although time the spent on a machine is computed, no 
            scheduling of several products that may be using the same machine is 
            considered. The models are simple and deterministic, but they do 
            provide insights on the aspects of the system that contribute the 
            most to WIP and its cost. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

            <P align=left>Lot sizes play an important role in the models. 
            Throughout we assume that lots travel through the system uniformly 
            in time. With a flow rate of 100 per week and a lot size of 1, a 
            unit passes any given point in the system every 0.01 weeks. With a 
            lot size of 3, a lot of three units passes the point every 0.03 
            weeks. The figure below shows the process involved with changing lot 
            sizes from 1 to 3. The lot size change occurs at an accumulation 
            point where single units enter the point every 0.01 weeks and lots 
            of 3 leave every 0.03 weeks. The figure shows an accumulation 
            beginning at time 0.04. Units accumulate at 0.05 and 0.06. At time 
            0.06 the lot of 3 units has accumulated and is released. The 
            inventory pattern is periodic. A second period is shown beginning at 
            time 0.07. Steady state will see the pattern below repeated every 
            0.03 weeks.</P>

            <P align=left>The blue area indicates WIP that accumulates because 
            of the lot size change. Considering a period of 0.03 weeks, the area 
            under the WIP curve is 3 units. The average WIP is </P>
            <P align=center><EM>WIP = Area for one period/Length of 
            period</EM></P>
            <P align=left>For the example the average WIP is 1. The average 
            residence time for a unit experiencing a lot size change is 
            determined by Little's Law. To agree with common terminology used 
            when discussing manufacturing systems we call the average residence 
            time the <EM>cycle time</EM>.</P>
            <P align=center><EM>Cycle Time = WIP/Flow rate</EM></P>
            <P align=left>For the example the flow rate is 100/week, therefore 
            the cycle time for the lot size change operation is 0.01 weeks. Note 
            that the use of cycle time may result in some confusion since we 
            have previously used the term to describe the interval over which 
            the inventory pattern repeats. In this discussion we call the 
            repeating interval the <EM>period</EM>.</P>
            <P align=left>To understand the lot size change operation, consider 
            the figures below. The figure shows the cumulative arrivals and 
            departures during a change of lot size from Q to 1.5Q. The 
            cumulative arrivals are shown in blue. The cumulative departures are 
            in red overlaying the arrivals. The length of the period is 3T, 
            where <EM>T = Q/D</EM>.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG height=290 
            src="Computation - Operations Management-Industrial Engineering_files/lot_chg_graphs.jpg" 
            width=274></P>
            <P align=left>For feasibility the departures can occur only after

            shown in the second figure. This figure is constructed by 
            subtracting the departure graph from the arrival graph. To compute

            the model. The number of rows used depends on the type of model. For 
            the example the parameters are in rows 1 through 7. The first entry 
            is set by the user to identify the inventory. The other parameters 
            may be changed except the <EM>Data Name</EM> and <EM>Type</EM>. The

            by the program and should not be changed. All numeric parameters are 
            to be nonnegative.</P>
            <P align=left>Rows 8 and 9 hold the instance variables. The 
            important variables for the lot size change component is the input 
            and output lot sizes. We give different values for three cases.</P>
            <P align=left>The next three rows, row 10 through row 12, hold the 
            instance results. The <EM>WIP</EM> is the average inventory produced 
            by this component. The <EM>Cycle Time </EM>is the average residence 
            time that an item remains in inventory. Finally, the <EM>WIP 
            Cost</EM> is the cost associated with holding the average WIP. Since 
            the value of a unit of WIP is $1000 and the holding cost rate is 
            0.5% per week, the holding cost is $5 per unit per week.</P>
            <P align=left>We see in the illustration, that when there is no 
            change in lot size, there is no WIP. Changing the lot size from 1 to 
            3 results in the WIP and cycle time previously described. The change 
            from 3 to 1 is symmetric to the change from 1 to 3 and has the same 
            WIP.</P>
            <P align=left>A second example is shown below. Here we hold the 
            average of the input and output lot sizes at 90, but change their 
            relative values.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG height=165

            width=393></P>
            <P align=left>The results are perhaps counterintuitive. When the 
            input and output lot sizes have the greatest difference in case 3, 
            the WIP is the smallest. Since all three cases have the same 
            average, 90, we note the major effect of the gdc. If the lot sizes 
            are the same, the gdc is the same as the lot size, so the WIP is 0. 
            When the lot sizes differ by a factor of 2, the gdc is the smaller 
            of the two lot sizes, and the WIP is the average less the smaller 
            lot size (90 - 60 = 30 as in the third case). The effect of a lot 
            size change on WIP is highly nonlinear. Note that the WIP caused by 
            a lot size change is a function of only the input and output lot 
            sizes and not on the flow rate.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

            <P><FONT color=#000000>There are many causes for delays in 
            manufacturing systems. Sometimes delays are part of the 
            manufacturing process such as a drying period required after 
            painting. Others are due to undesirable occurrences such as part 
            shortages or scheduling conflicts. In every case we model a delay as 
            a fixed time, independent of flow rate, added to the cycle time of a 
            lot size change. The illustration shows a delay of 0.1 weeks. The 
            resultant WIP is determined by Little's Law. The first two cases are 
            the same except that the flow rate for Wait 2 is twice that of Wait 
            1. With the delay constant, the WIP is doubled. Wait 3 shows the 
            result combining a lot size change with the delay. The lot size 
            change contributes 30 to the WIP while the delay contributes

            <P><FONT color=#000000>The system option constructs a model of 
            several components arranged in series and adds the results. An 
            example is shown below. Here we consider a sequence of processing 
            operations. We are comparing the WIP and total cycle time for high 
            and low lot sizes. From observing the two results we see that the 
            smaller lot size results in a total WIP and cycle time less than 1/4 
            the value for the larger lot size. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT color=#000000>The components of the system can be any of 
            those considered on this page. They are identified by the word 
            placed in the Type row. Note that we have not colored the cells 
            yellow for this display. The delay, bank and lot size components use 
            fewer parameters than than the other components. The contents of the 
            extra cells are ignored. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT color=#000000>The flow rates in row 4 are all linked by 
            formulas to the flow rate of the first component. All flows are 
            equal for this series arrangement. The <EM>System</EM> command on 
            the menu allows several other arrangements of components including a 
            tree arrangement and a general network arrangement. These options 
            are described on the next page.</FONT></P>
