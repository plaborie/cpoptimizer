Gent, Christopher Jefferson, Ian Miguel, Peter Nightingale', '', 'Many constraint problems contain symmetry, which can lead to redundant search. If a partial assignment is shown to be invalid, we are wasting time if we ever consider a symmetric equivalent of it. A particularly important class of symmetries are those introduced by the constraint modelling process: model symmetries. We present a systematic method by which the automated constraint modelling tool CONJURE can break conditional symmetry as it enters a model during refinement. Our method extends, and is compatible with, our previous work on automated symmetry breaking in CONJURE. The result is the automatic and complete removal of model symmetries for the entire problem class represented by the input specification. This applies to arbitrarily nested conditional symmetries and represents a significant step forward for automated constraint modelling.'],

Yet, establishing links between data sets is not an easy task. We develop an approach for that purpose which extracts weak linkkeys. Linkkeys extend the notion of a key to the case of different data sets. They are made of a set of pairs of properties belonging to two different classes. A weak linkkey holds between two classes if any resources having common values for all of these properties are the same resources. An algorithm is proposed to generate a small set of candidate linkkeys. Depending on whether some of the, valid or invalid, links are known, we define supervised and non supervised measures for selecting the appropriate linkkeys. The supervised measures approximate precision and recall, while the non supervised measures are the ratio of pairs of entities a linkkey covers (coverage), and the ratio of entities from the same data set it identifies (discrimination). We have experimented these techniques on two data sets, showing the accuracy and robustness of both approaches.'],

One can take these communicative actions to be ‘telephone calls’, and this process of spreading information is known as gossiping [4]. It is typical to assume a global scheduler who simply executes a possibly non-deterministic protocol. Such a protocol can be seen as consisting of a sequence of instructions “first, agent a calls b, then c, next, d calls b ...”. We investigate epistemic gossip protocols, where an agent a will call another agent not because it is so instructed but based on its knowledge or ignorance of the factual information that is distributed over the network. Such protocols therefore don\'t need a central schedular, but they come at a cost: they may take longer to terminate than non-epistemic, globally scheduled, protocols. We describe various epistemic protocols, we give their logical properties, and we model them in a number of ways.'],

Despite their diversity, there is a common structure to their design. A negotiation agent comprises three key components: the bidding strategy, the opponent model and the acceptance criteria. We show that this three-component view of a negotiating architecture not only provides a useful basis for developing such agents but also provides a useful analytical tool. By combining these components in varying ways, we are able to demonstrate the contribution of each component to the overall negotiation result, and thus determine the key contributing components. Moreover, we study the interaction between components and present detailed interaction effects. Furthermore, we find that the bidding strategy in particular is of critical importance to the negotiator\'s success and far exceeds the importance of opponent preference modeling techniques. Our results contribute to the shaping of a research agenda for negotiating agent design by providing guidelines on how agent developers can spend their time most effectively.'],

The parameter we focus on is the maximal number of paths in the domain-transition graphs, and we show that for this parameter, optimal planning is fpt for planning instances with polytree causal graphs and acyclic domain-transition graphs. If this parameter is combined with the additional parameters of domain size for the variables and the treewidth of the causal graph, then planning is fpt also for instances with arbitrary causal graphs. Furthermore, all these parameters are fpt to test in advance. These results also imply that delete-relaxed planning is fpt, even in its recent generalisation to non-binary variables.'],

However when teammates do communicate, it can provide a valuable channel for coordination. Therefore, this paper tackles the problem of communication in ad hoc teams, introducing a minimal version of the multiagent, multiarmed bandit problem with limited communication between the agents.

Both the time efficiency and the space efficiency of Sym-FBDD<inf>X,Y</inf> and Sym-DDG<inf>X,Y</inf> are analyzed, in order to put those languages in the knowledge compilation map for propositional representations.

In this paper when classifying a new item, we demonstrate a new approach where we focus on a small part of the triples available. To restrict the scope of the search, we first look for examples that are as similar as possible to the new item to be classified. We then only consider the pairs of examples presenting the same dissimilarity as between the new item and one of its closest neighbors. Thus we implicitly build triples that are in analogical proportion on all attributes with the new item. Then the classification is made on the basis of a majority vote on the pairs leading to a solvable class equation.

The state-of-the-art factored belief tracking (FBT) method addresses this problem by maintaining multiple smaller projected belief states, each involving only a subset of the variable set. Its complexity is exponential in the size of these subsets, as opposed to the entire variable set, without jeopardizing completeness. In this paper we develop the theory of regression to serve as an alternative tool for belief-state maintenance. Regression is a well known technique enjoying similar, and potentially even better worst-case complexity, as its complexity depends on the actions and observations that actually took place, rather than all actions and potential observations, as in the FBT method. On the other hand, FBT is likely to have better amortized complexity if the number of queries to the belief state is very large. An empirical comparison of regression with FBT-based belief maintenance is carried out, showing that the two perform similarly.'],

Most of the research has been concentrating on making query answering efficient. Howeverquery answering is not the only service that an OBDA system must provide. Another crucial service is consistency checking. Current approaches to this problem involves executing expensive queries at run-time.

The transformation forces agents to select joint actions associated with a single subset of objects at a time, and ensures that the concurrency constraints on this subset are satisfied. Joint actions are serialised such that each agent performs their part of the action separately. The number of actions in the resulting single-agent planning problem turns out to be manageable in many real-world domains, thus allowing the problem to be solved efficiently using a standard single-agent planner. We also describe a cost-optimal algorithm for compressing the resulting plan, i.e. merging individual actions in order to reduce the total number of joint actions. Results show that our approach can handle large problems that are impossible to solve for most multiagent planners.'],

As this allows a true picture of the present, we additionally present an optimal version of the well-known UCT algorithm for partially observable single-player games. Instead of performing hindsight optimization on a simplified, fully observable tree, the true future is simulated on an action-observation tree that takes partial observability into account.

On the other hand, combining two rules X and Y, both with NP-hard CCAV and CCDV, could lead to a two-stage election, where both CCAV and CCDV become polynomial-time solvable.

One approach for solving MaxSAT is based on iterative SAT solving, which may optionally be guided by unsatisfiable cores. A difficulty with this class of algorithms is the possibly large number of times a SAT solver is called, e.g. for instances with very large clause weights. This paper proposes the use of geometric progressions to tackle this issue, thus allowing, for the vast majority of problem instances, to reduce the number of calls to the SAT solver.

Our intuition is that “bad actions” are often easier to characterize than “good” ones.

Fixing a canonical rule language and an off-the-shelf learning tool, we explore a novel method for generating training data, and implement rule evaluators in state-of-the-art planners.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation, as a topic modeling approach, is able to identify diverse topics, from which the rules can be derived. The resulting rules are less redundant and can also be interpreted by the corresponding topic. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the presented approach provides rule sets with better rule redundancy and diversity compared to those of four existing algorithms.

We argue that with an elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However, with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence, the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.'],

However, currently, there is no systematic approach for setting the honesty threshold. We propose a self-adaptive honesty threshold management mechanism based on PID feedback controller.

In response, in this paper we propose an explanation generation technique, which follows user-derived explanation patterns.

The technique includes algorithms that select relevant attributes and produce an explanation that justifies an automated choice.

Not only does CV-width dominate the incidence graph treewidth, but the former width can be bounded when the latter is unbounded. We also introduce a restricted version of CV-width, called linear CV-width, and show that it dominates both pathwidth and cutwidth, which have been used to bound the complexity of OBDDs. We show that CNFs can be compiled into OBDDs in time and space that are exponential only in linear CV-width.

In the work described here we have coupled MATSim with a BDI (Belief Desire Intention) system to allow both more extensive modelling of the agent\'s decision making, as well as reactivity to environmental situations. The approach used allows for all agents to be “intelligent” or for some to be “intelligent”/reactive, while others operate according to plans that are static within a single day. The former is appropriate for simulations such as a bushfire evacuation, where all agents will be reacting to the changing environment. The latter is suited to introducing agents such as taxis into a standard MATSim simulation, as they cannot realistically have a predetermined plan, but must constantly respond to the current situation. We have prototype applications for both bushfire evacuation and taxis. By extending the capabilities of MATSim to allow agents to respond intelligently to changes in the environment, we facilitate the use of MATSim in a wide range of simulation applications.

This approach can be used by the knowledge engineer in constructing a well-formed Markov logic network if data for learning is not available.

When using existential rules as ontological language, query answering is an undecidable problem, whence numerous decidable classes of ontologies have been defined, ranging from classes with very good computational complexities (AC0 in data complexity) to classes with much larger expressivity. However, actually implementable algorithms have been proposed only for very restricted classes (typically those coinciding with lightweight description logics). The aim of this paper is to show how to deal with more expressive ontologies by proposing an algorithm that performs both materialization and rewriting and is applicable for a significant generalization of lightweight description logics. To this end, we first modify an existing algorithm previously proposed for a very generic class of rules, namely greedy bounded treewidth sets of rules. We then exhibit a special case, called pattern oblivious rule sets, which significantly generalizes the ℰℒℋ<sup>dr</sup> description logic, which underlies the OWL 2 EL ontology standard, while keeping the beneficial worst-case computational complexity. We last define a subclass of pattern oblivious rules that is recognizable in polynomial time.'],

The PeerRank method also provides an incentive for agents to grade correctly. As the grades of an agent depend on the grades of the grading agents, and as these grades themselves depend on the grades of other agents, we define the PeerRank method by a fixed point equation similar to the PageRank method for ranking web-pages. We identify some formal properties of the PeerRank method (for example, it satisfies axioms of unanimity, no dummy, no discrimination and symmetry), discuss some examples, compare with related work and evaluate the performance on some synthetic data. Our results show considerable promise, reducing the error in grade predictions by a factor of 2 or more in many cases over the natural baseline of averaging peer grades.'],

Sometimes it can be useful to have an adventurous form of preference inference when the input information is relatively weak, for example, in a conversational recommender system context, to give some justification for showing some options before others.

We first show that the auctions we get with the single-minded decomposition are FNP if those for single-minded bidders satisfy a condition called PIA. We then show that another condition, weaker than PIA, is necessary for the decomposition to build FNP auctions. To close the gap between the two conditions, we have found another sufficient condition weaker than PIA for the decomposition to produce strategy-proof mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that once we have PIA, the mechanisms created by the decomposition actually satisfy a stronger version of false-name-proofness, called false-name-proofness with withdrawal.'],

While SIW does not use heuristic estimators of any sort, it manages to solve more problems than a Greedy BFS using a heuristic like h<inf>add</inf>.

In this short paper, we introduce two simple extension to IW and SIW that narrow the performance gap with state-of-the-art planners.

We empirically compare such dynamic pricing strategies with fixed cost strategies, and suggest future extensions to this work.'],

Our fair-MC<sup>2</sup> algorithm is novel in demonstrating how (a) the uncertainty in the locations, directions, speeds, and observation times of the targets arising from the stochasticity of their motion can be modeled probabilistically, (b) the notion of fairness in observing targets can be formally realized in the domain of multi-camera surveillance for the first time by exploiting the max-min fairness metric to formalize our surveillance objective, that is, to maximize the expected minimum observation time over all targets while guaranteeing a predefined image resolution of observing them, and (c) a structural assumption in the state transition dynamics of a surveillance environment can be exploited to improve its scalability to linear time in the number of targets to be observed during surveillance. Empirical evaluation through extensive simulations in realistic surveillance environments shows that fair-MC<sup>2</sup> outperforms the state-of-the-art and baseline MC<sup>2</sup> algorithms.

The results contribute to a better understanding which knowledge humans employ to build up interpretations from perceived words and establish their confidence in perception and interpretation. The findings provide useful input for SDS developers and enable researchers to estimate the potential benefit of future research avenues."'],

The search agents in A! share information asynchronously and trade some of their independence for additional search focus and a more global view of the search task. A! is inherently nondeterministic due to the implicit randomness of instruction scheduling, but given a consistent primary heuristic, it still finds optimal solutions for the single-source shortest path problem (SSSP). A! combines into a single cooperative search algorithm the breadth available in parallel execution and the depth-first orientation of both locally and globally informed search. We experimentally show that A! outperforms both vanilla A* and an explicitly randomized, noncooperative parallel A* variant. We present an empirical study on cooperation benefits and scalability in the classic 15-puzzle context. The results imply that cooperation and concurrency can successfully be harnessed in algorithm design, inviting further inquiry into algorithms of this kind."'],

The vehicle has limited battery power and memory to store datasets and does not know how much of these resources its actions will consume. Managing the uncertainty by building contingency plans (as in previous work) is infeasible owing to the large number of contingencies. Purely online planning is also difficult because of restricted computation. We propose a mixture of off-line planning and on-line plan repair, presenting an approach for deleting parts of a plan when resources are tight, or stitching new plan fragments into an existing plan when additional resources are available. We discuss this novel approach using a simulated AUV mission domain.'],

It is an iterative learning procedure starting with a predefined topology and randomly-chosen initial parameters. However, state-of-the-art approaches based on arbitrarily defined state numbers and parameters can cause the risk of falling into a local optima and a low convergence speed with enormous number of iterations in learning which is computationally expensive. For models with persistent states, i.e. states with high self-transition probabilities, we propose a segmentation-based identification approach used as a pre-identification step to approximately estimate parameters based on segmentation and clustering techniques. The identified parameters serve as input of the Baum-Welch algorithm. Moreover, the proposed approach identifies automatically the state numbers. Experimental results conducted on both synthetic and real data show that the segmentation-based identification approach can identify H(S)MMs more accurately and faster than the current Baum-Welch algorithm.'],

In recent years, there have been efforts to extend their framework to Description Logics (DLs) and a solid (though preliminary) theoretical foundation has already been established towards this aim. Despite this foundation, the generalisation of the propositional framework to DLs is not yet complete and there are multiple proposals for entailment in this context with no formal system for deciding between these. In addition, there are virtually no existing preferential reasoning implementations to speak of for DL-based ontologies. The goals of this PhD are: to place the preferential approach in context w.r.t. the alternative nonmonotonic reasoning proposals, to provide a complete generalisation of the preferential framework of KLM to the DL ALC, provide a formal understanding of the relationships between the multiple proposals for entailment in this context, and finally, to develop an accompanying defeasible reasoning system for DL-based ontologies with performance that is suitable for use in existing ontology development settings.'],

Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are temporal probabilistic graphical models that model temporal processes, temporal relationships between events and state changes through time. In this paper, we propose the integration of TA methods with DBNs in the context of medical decision-support systems, by presenting an extended DBN model. More specifically, we demonstrate the derivation of temporal abstractions which are used for building the network structure. We also apply machine learning algorithms to learn the parameters of the model through data. The model is applied for diagnosis of coronary heart disease using as testbed a longitudinal dataset. The classification accuracy of our model evaluated using the evaluation metrics of Precision, Recall and F1-score, shows the effectiveness of our proposed system.'],

In this paper we present the search space decomposition formalism SSD that models parallel SAT solvers with clause sharing and inprocessing. The main result of this paper is that the sharing model SSD is sound. In the formalism, we combine clause addition and clause elimination techniques, and it covers many SAT solvers such as PaSAT, PaMira, PMSat, MiraXT and ccc. Inprocessing is not used in these solvers, and we therefore propose a novel way how to combine clause sharing, search space decomposition and inprocessing.'],

Research in the past years has shown that Pareto-based multi-objective approach for solving this problem is preferred to the traditional single-objective approach. Multi-objective learning can be represented as search that starts either from an accurate classifier and modifies it in order to produce more comprehensible classifiers (e.g. extracting rules from ANNs) or the other way around: starts from a comprehensible classifier and modifies it to produce more accurate classifiers. This paper presents a case study of applying a recent algorithm for multi-objective learning of hybrid trees MOLHC in human activity recognition domain.

Although powerful, AFs have their shortcomings, which led to development of numerous enrichments. Among the most general ones are the abstract dialectical frameworks, also known as the ADFs. They make use of the so-called acceptance conditions to represent arbitrary relations. This level of abstraction brings not only new challenges, but also requires addressing existing problems in the field. One of the most controversial issues, recognized not only in argumentation, concerns the support or positive dependency cycles. In this paper we introduce a new method to ensure acyclicity of arguments and present a family of extension-based semantics built on it, along with their classification w.r.t. cycles. Finally, we provide ADF versions of the properties known from the Dung setting.'],

More advanced systems generate personalized routes taking into account user preferences and traveling distances between sights. Recommenders can be used in order to estimate user\'s interest in the available sights. Typically recommendations are then fed into a planning algorithm that tries to determine a subset of sights and a suitable order. The aim being to include the most interesting sites for the user and possibly as many interesting sights as possible within a given set of constraints. Additional constraints can be considered such as a sight being a must-see for the user or opening hours of sights. At some point the generated route is shown to the user. If the user is not satisfied with the route he may want to change it. In most systems modifying the constraints or user preferences and then regenerating a completely new route is the only option to accomplish this task. More fine-grained control over route modifications is in typically unavailable. In this paper we examine how sightseeing tourists can be supported in editing an automatically generated route. We discuss what is necessary for editing operations to meet user\'s expectations. We then show how six different route editing operations can be implemented via the idea of collapsing and expanding a route. Finally we present a potential route editing user interface for an electronic tourist guide. The presented interface makes disadvantageous route modifications obvious by providing instant feedback on how an operation affects the route."'],
