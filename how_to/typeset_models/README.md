A document proposing a way to typeset CP Optimizer models in LaTeX is available [here](conventions.pdf).

Here is the adaptation of these conventions that we will adopt for typesetting CP Optimizer models in text format.

## Scopes

A scope is a set of tuples used for indexing. For describing a scope, we use the
classical set notation. For instance if N and M are two integers:
* `i in [1,N]` is the set of all integers i in {1,2,...,N}
* `i in [1,N], j in [1,M]` is the cartesian product (i,j) in [1,N]x[1,M]
* `i,j in [1,N] | i!=j` is the subset of the cartesian product [1,N]x[1,N] such that i!=j

When the order of the elements in the scope is important (like for instance
in the vectors or matrices below), the tuples are supposed to be generated by
iterating on the indexes from left to right. For instance:
`i,j in [1,3] | i!=j` will generate the ordered set of tuples (1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2).

## Vectors

Vectors are denoted `[v[i] : SCOPE(i)]`. For instance:

`[x[i][j] : i,j in [1,N] | i!=j]`


## Matrices
